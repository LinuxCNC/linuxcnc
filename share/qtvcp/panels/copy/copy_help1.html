<H3>QtVCP Copy</H3>
<p>Used for copying QtVCPâ€™s builtin Screens, VCP Panels, QtVismach code to a folder so one can customize it.</p>
<p>Copying the builtin screen code to a configuration folder will signal QtVCP to load the local version instead.</p>
<p>Then you can modify this version without changing the original code files.</p>
<p>Erasing/renaming the folder will return the builtin screen.</p>
