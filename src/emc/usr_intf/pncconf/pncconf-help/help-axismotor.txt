Axis Motor Configuration Page:
    Depending on previous page selections, not all of
    these options will show.

Servo Info:
    This is for setting up the servo control loop.
        P - proportional term
        I - integral term
        D - derivative term
        FF0 - zero order feed forward
        FF1 - first order feed forward
        FF2 - second order feed forward
        Bias - used to add / subract a constant value to dac.
        Deadband - if the actual position is in this band
            of the commanded proportional control will not be 
            added.
        Dac scale      - scales the output nominal is +-1 volt
        Dac Max output - clamps the output to +- this value
        Dac offset     - used to offset dac range. 

Brushless Control:
    select this to use and configure the BLDC component.
    The BLDC component can be used to control brushless motors
    directly and for HALL sensor conversions. See the MAN pages.

Open loop servo test Button:
    Use this test to confirm proper Dac output.
    It is important to confirm the motor turns in the positive
    direction when the positive jog button is pressed.
    It is important to confirm the encoder counts in the positive 
    direction when the motor turns in the positive direction.
    If this is not true expect a SERVO MOTOR RUN AWAY when using
    PID control!
    You can also confirm the encoder scaling is correct, by moving
    the axis a known distance and noting the encoder count.
    The limit switches are not functional during this test.

Spindle-at-speed settings:
    Set the scaling or the rpm difference so EMC knows when the spindle
    is close enough to the requested speed. Spindle feedback or spindle
    at speed signal is required for this.

Stepper Info:
    This is for setting up the Stepper control loop:
        step on time    - minimum time in nanoseconds for the step pulse.
        Step Space      - minimum time between steps.
        Direction Hold  - minimum time between last step and direction change.
        Direction Setup - minimum time for direction signal.
        Driver type     - choose a pre determined driver timing
        motor steps     - number of electrical steps for motor usually 200
        microstepping   - microstepping multiplication factor.
        motor steps times microstepping = number of steps per revolution.

Axis info:
    Encoder Scale    - number of pulses per unit of axis movement.
    Stepper Scale    - number of steps per unit of axis movement.
    Max velocity     - in units per MINUTE.
    Max Acceleration - in units per SECOND squared.  
    Rapid speed following error - amount actual can deviate from commanded.
    Feed speed following error  - amount actual can deviate from commanded.
    Invert motor direction      - check to reverse motor direction
    Invert encoder direction    - check to reverse encoder direction

Calculate Scale Button:
    You can enter scaling directly or use this dialog to calculate them.
    check the boxes to add the setting to the calculation.

    Pulley Teeth    - use this if using a pulley or gear drive.
                      or uncheck for direct drive. Enter the
                      number of teeth of the cogs/gears not the
                      gear ratio.
    Worm turn ratio - use this for worm drives. Enter the gear
                      ratio. EG if two turns of input = one of output
                      enter 2:1 The encoder is assumed connected to 
                      the input.
    Leadscrew       - pitch (metric) or TPI of leadscrew.
    Encoder lines   - the number of basic lines (not pulses) of the encoder.
    Microsteps      - the multiplication factor to apply to motor steps. 
    Motor steps     - the number of steps of motor (usually 200).
                      one could uncheck the microstep checkbox and just
                      enter the total number of steps per revolution of
                      the step drive.

    The scale settings change as you enter data / check boxes.
    The motion data is just for information.
    If you wish to use the settings press apply otherwise cancel.


Test / Tune Axis Button:
    Use this to test and tune the current axis.
    This is unavailable for servos or if using simulated realtime.
    set the velocity, acceleration and control loop settings.
    jog to a safe zone close to the middle of axis.
    set the test distance and choose a movement type:
        +- for moving both sides of start point.
        - for moving between zero and negative side.
        + for moving between zero and positive side.
    choose a pause time.
    press run and the test will move back and forth pausing 
    at each end of travel.
    pressing OK will transfer the settings to the axis page.
    pressing cancel will keep the existing settings.
