ver. 1.3.5.1
- forgot to reset the gcode error, resulting in showing it only once,
  it ws not shown again if a good file was loaded and than again the 
  wrong one, now the load and edit button do reset the error code. 

ver. 1.3.5
- added the new signal from hal_gremlin to gmoccapy so we do get 
  a message of gcode errors when loading a file and not only when
  the interpreter does read the wrong line. A warning box will inform 
  about the error details.

ver. 1.3.4
- if no virtual keyboard was installed (nor onboard or matchbox),
  the checkboxes on the settings page has not been sensitized and the
  settings has not been reseted correctly from the preference file
  Thanks to Roland (concierge) for finding this one

ver. 1.3.3
- the combobox for the mouse button mode has not been initialized
  correct, if it had the default value of the glade file. It is a 
  bug in glade. The work around is not to set a default value in glade
  but in the python code.

ver. 1.3.2
- fixed a small bug PAUSE button did not get active on M01
  Thanks to Rick (LAIR82) for pointing on it.

ver. 1.3.1
- fixed very serious bug PAUSE / RESUME / STOP issue
  Program jumped to strange positions if STOP has been pressed 
  while PAUSE was active.
  Thanks to Mael (papaours) for finding it.

ver. 1.3.0.1
- corrected a bug, toolchange velocity hal pin have not been
  preseted with values, if the user worked with the
  default values, so a probing with vel = 0 was posible, 
  resulting in an error
- correctet an error in notifications.py, as the text to be
  displayed has not been checked for correct pango format, a
  message like "vel <= 0" resulted in an error. Now the necessary 
  check is done

ver. 1.3.0
- added replace function to the edit page
- added ignore case to allow case sensitive search
- added reload button on edit page, so if you 
  mixed up to much, you are able to reload the
  original file
- corrected an error at start up, giving a button
  a label, conflicting with a button label
- changed a wrong icon on the button go up one directory

ver. 1.2.2
- changed the way the window size and position is 
  handled, as bevore the default values did apear 
  several times in the code
- If no virtual keyboard could be initialized, we 
  disable now the coresponding part on the settings
  page and the related button. Check will be done
  for <onboard> and <matchbox-keyboard>
- starting gmoccapy did throw an error to the terminal
  that a widget could not get default. Finally I found 
  the reason, the glade file did contain a property
  "has_default" and that is not allowed by builder.

ver. 1.2.1
- due to the behavior of XFCE of the new hybrid.iso I 
  had to change the width settings of several button
  to stretch them to fit some text and images
- The same reason forced to set new default startposition
  of the main window and the notification messages.

ver. 1.2.0
- changed GetIniInfo to return also user message setups
- notification now supports pango markup in the messages
- added hal user messages similar to gsreeen to gmoccapy
  see gmoccapy_messages.ini for usage information
- updated the translation files for German and Spanish 

ver. 1.1.5.9
- prepared yesno_dialog for user message, 
  it does accept now pango markup
- wrong values in axis offset didn't show a message
  to the user, I fixed that

ver. 1.1.5.8
- message at start because of
  return(PlasmaClass(halcomp, builder, useropts))
  instedt off
  return[PlasmaClass(halcomp, builder, useropts)]
  resulting in iteration over none object

ver. 1.1.5.7
- init dynamic tab now in try except to avoid python exception
  on user typos in ini file
- loading a tool using remap, leaded to an error if no file has been 
  loaded before the change, we do check for that now to avoid the error

ver. 1.1.5.6
- introduced three new hal-pin to signal program progress informations
  gmoccapy.program.length = S32, OUT (total number of program lines)
  gmoccapy.program.current-line =S32, OUT (current executed line)
  gmoccapy.program.progress = FLOAT, OUT (progress in %)

  This pin do not work very perfect when using subroutines or remap procedures

ver. 1.1.5.5
- if using remap, an error has been launched, if the user used the buttons of 
  the tool edit widget to change the tools (not posible to change to auto mode)
  I moved the resting procedure of self.tool_change to hal_status_intp_idle
  to solve the wrong behavior

ver. 1.1.5.4
- solved a bug showing screen2 at start up. Screen2 was initialized to early
  resulting in a runtime error

ver. 1.1.5.3
- solved a bug if the user have NO_FORCE_HOMING in his INI and did a homing
  of an axis, resulting in some widgets being unsensitive.
  Thanks to Marius for reportinmg that one
- after a tool touch off no G43 was commited even if that code was active 
  so I added that command to be executed
  Thanks to Rene to report that one
- some minor changes to lathe.ini, having HOME two times in the AXIS config

ver. 1.1.5.2
- solved a bug, on clear G92 offsets handling, switching the GUI to MDI Mode,
  due to a strange behavior of the offsetpage widget, not going back to the 
  previous mode.

ver. 1.1.5.1
- solved a bug related to the gmoccapy error pin. This pin has not been reseted
  if the user used the mouse or touch screen and errased the message by clicking
  the message button. It was only done right if the delete-message pin was used.
  I modified notification.py to emit a signal if a message has been deleted and 
  conected this signal to gmoccapy. 
- corrected also a small mistake in _show_errors, it was posible to get messages
  without text, added a default text. 

ver. 1.1.5
- added a option to hide the 4'th axis, this is useful if that axis is used
  to control a tool changer, as than the axis DRO and jog button are not needed.
  This has to be activated on the settings page, axis 4 is shown by default.
  This needed some code rework (moving code around)
- solved the problem of pin_value changes on start up / initializing, because I
  introduced a new intern variable self.initialized, leaving defs if not True
- introduced a adjustment widget on the settings page to allow the user to set
  the font size of the DRO, it will be reduced by 3/4 if 4 axis are used

ver. 1.1.4
- added again the gcode.lang file, it got lost, after changing gmoccapy to be
  stand alone
- the show screen2 button is now only sensitive if a file gmoccapy2.glade does
  exist in the config dir. 

ver. 1.1.3
- it was possible to push btn_set_selected on offset page to set a coordinate
  system with G92 selected, or being in edit offset mode, this is now avoided.

ver. 1.1.2
- after changing units according to G20 / G21 the scales to be applied to
  the jog wheel pin (jog_vel and max_vel has not been changed, resulting in
  very large jumps after changing from metric to imperial, i.e. one count
  should move the slider 100 increments in metric, but did that amount also 
  in imperial, insteadt only advancing 4 steps.
- all sliders and vel infos are now changing according to G20/G21 beeing active.
- There is still work to do on the offsetpage widget, IMHO it is buggy

ver. 1.1.1
- small bug in macro button handling, if a macro was not found, gmoccapy
  raised an exception, because wrong variable name.

ver. 1.1
- this is the "final" version, ready to be included in a release candidate
  I did not change anything related to the last push, but after 1.10.2, I 
  made a mistake with the release number, this push correct the error.

ver. 1.0.3.2
- includes version number also in settings page as label in the botton button bar

ver. 1.0.3.1
- previous changes to NO_FORCE_HOMING resulted in automatic starting from
  line if a line has been selected in preview, I changed that so the line
  is just presetted, but not taken in care if run is pressed. The other way
  was to dangerous.

ver. 1.0.3
- solved some bugs in NO_FORCE_HOMING not handled the correct way
  with start button and mode changes after setup page
- get rid of hal_toggleaction_run and hal_action_stop, as the run widget
  caused one of the problems

ver. 1.0.2.1
- spindle feedback bar changes will not effect any more the
  speed label value. It was doble information and at the same
  time confusing for users. The spindle feedback bar will 
  indicate the real spindle speed and the feed label will show 
  the programmed value.

ver. 1.0.2
- solved a bug in getting active gcodes, because I took also the first 
  element of linuxcnc.stat.gcodes, but that seems not to be a gcode, but 
  some kind of control number or something like that, so it causes wrong 
  code and changed gmoccapy behavior in an erroneous way
- In this bug finding I also needed to change the gladevcp widget combiDRO
  to get the correct results

ver. 1.0.10.2
- solved a smal bug with _set_spindle in auto mode

ver. 1.0.10.1
- gremlin mouse button mode has not been initialized at start up

ver. 1.0.10
- changed the behavior of the spindle feedback bar and the speed labels
  we do not change the bar limits from negative to positive, we use
  from now on only abs values! That is the reason I did include a additional 
  abs in the postgui hal file
- corrected an error, not allowing to switch spindle on / off while program paused

ver. 1.0.9
- the ignore limits has not been called, due to a missing signal from the
  glade file, also the checkbox was hidden if machine off, so it could
  not be activated after hitting a limit switch.

ver. 1.0.8
- Thanks to Steffen Noack we got new gremlin function for the mouse button 
  behavior. Gmoccapy allows selecting the button mode from the settings page

ver. 1.0.7.1
- when a external ESTOP was active and the tbtn_estop has been clicked 
  it changed its color, but should not do so, solved
- when external estop was active, it was possible to click the on button
  and the GUI changed state making several widgets sensitive, that behavior
  was wrong, solved that.
- If you feed override has been changed and the machine went into estop, 
  a estop reset also reseted feed override to 100 % , now it will remain with 
  the value it had bevore estop.
- If a user activate logging actions, the logging was lost after shutting
  down the GUI, now the conmtent of alarm_history will be written to a 
  file called gmoccapy.log in your config dir. The file will be overwritten 
  on each shutdown of gmoccapy with the new content.
- EXIT Button is now only sensitive, when machine is switched off, so it is
  not longer possible to accidently shut down the machine.
- pressing estop from MDI mode with spindle on, resulted in an error, solved.

ver. 1.0.7
- Reworked the emergency button behavior as well as the 
  on/off button, as it was possible to set the GUI in an ESTOP_RESET
  state, even if an external SWITCH was in ESTOP State. The important
  bug has been found by Steffen, he also suplied the initial patch,
  witch has been adapted to my coding style ;-)
- Next changed the error handling, separated the error reporting from
  periodic to an own function, so we are able to lauch also our own 
  errors over the same chanel, and get error pin height and also 
  the sound will be played.
- Deleted some unneeded or doble code.

ver. 1.0.6.3
- Bug turning on flood with M8 and logging actions on,
  found by Stephen, solved that one

ver. 1.0.6.2
- changed the standard setting of box_custom_? from
  expand = True to expand=False, so the panel will fit better
  found from verser building Z_compensation

ver. 1.0.6.1
- forgot to set error pin height if an error ocures ;-)

ver. 1.0.6
- Stefan found an error in getiniinfo, getting the PROGRAM_PREFIX from 
  INI file, if the entry does not exist. Solved!

ver. 1.0.6
- introduced new locations for EMBEDDED_TABS, it is possible to use 
  in addition to the previous ones now also:

  * box_cooling (will hide the cooling frame and introduce your glade file)
  * box_spindle (will hide the spindle frame and introduce your glade file)
  * box_vel_info  (will hide the velocity frames and introduce your glade file)
  * box_custom_1 (will introduce your glade file left of vel_frame)
  * box_custom_2 (will introduce your glade file left of cooling_frame)
  * box_custom_3 (will introduce your glade file left of spindle_frame)
  * box_custom_4 (will introduce your glade file right of spindle_frame)

  requested from verser

ver. 1.0.5 
- because of wrong steps in initializing the increment pins
  has not been made, I changed the init order and now they 
  are there again ;-)

ver. 1.0.4 - only plasma
- make the gmoccapy_plasma glade pannels react to theme changes
  after the theme change, a restart of the GUI is necessary

ver. 1.0.4
- corrected the way of excecuting a program step by step 

ver. 1.0.3
- pressing the OFF button will bring you back to manual
  mode, because there is the "EXIT" button

ver. 1.0.2
- solved a spindle button issue and included a check so it
  is no possible to exceed the limits of the spindle with 
  override values. i.e. a spindle has a max of 6000 rpm and
  the user enters S 5500 M3 now he can increase the spindle 
  override, but it will be limited by 109 %, because otherwise
  he would ask the spindle to run faster than allowed.

ver. 1.0.1
- solved a bug, because I forgot to include some signals 
  in glade file, so no jogging with button was possible

ver. 1.0
- we reached the stable state! 
  gmoccapy get completely separated from gsvreen, resultng 
  in a faster reaction and easieer support and maintanance,
  as there is now less influence from the other gui.

ver. 0.9.9.9.16
- a manual entry in the preference file logo = True in
  combination with logofile = "absolute path to logofile"
  will hide the jog button, jog increments and ignore limits
  and display the logo instead.

ver. 0.9.9.9.15
- new hal pin gscreen.error as bit out, to show an error to the
  hardware, so a light can lit or even stop the machine. It will
  reseted with the pin gscreen.delete-message. This command will
  delete the first error and reset the gscreen.error pin to False 
  after the last error has been cleared. Messages or user infos
  will not affect this pin!  

ver. 0.9.9.9.14
- The usage of  "EMBED_TAB_LOCATION = box_coolant_and_spindle"
  will not hide the velocity widgets any more, plasma handles
  that one now over tool_info_panel 

ver. 0.9.9.9.13
- solved a bug switching on/off the spindle if also log_actions
  was active, 

ver. 0.9.9.9.12
- added two hal pin to reset feed and spindle override
  gscreen.reset-feed-override
  gscreen.reset-spindle-override 

ver. 0.9.9.9.11
- solved startup bug, window not starting in position and 
  dimensions as set in settings page
- set new limits to size adjustments

ver. 0.9.9.9.10
- added a refresh command to iconview, otherwise adding a file
  and reopeninmg the view, would not refresh the view, so the 
  added file could not be selected

ver. 0.9.9.9.9
- I added three new hal pin. This pin do allow to reduce or 
  enlarge the soft limits, so a pin is able to protect your 
  rotary table from colision, because if you do not use it, 
  you just reduce your soft limits, or you got a tool changer
  in the working area, you do not want a collision during normal
  work, but you are forced to enter the tool change area to change 
  a tool, so during tool change you enlarge the soft limits.
  The pins are documented in the WIKI. You will get an error if you
  reduce the limits and you are outside the area!

ver. 0.9.9.9.8
- toggle button setup was not handled correct by hardware 
  momentary switches, fixed that

ver. 0.9.9.9.7
- add gcode highlight by clicking in the preview
  clicking a line in the preview will highlight the
  corresponding line in gcode listing

ver. 0.9.9.9.6
- solved show tool edit after program run
  after running a program and changing back to manual mode it was not 
  possible to enter again the tool edit tab, as we where taken to MDI mode
  this was mainly caused by the check for G43 beeing active.

ver. 0.9.9.9.5
- changed override behavior:
  feed override reduce the max velocity and the feed velocity, 
  but the jog vel slider will remain with it's value, 
  the override value will reduce the jog vel also!

ver. 0.9.9.9.4
- added a new pin to delete the last message

ver. 0.9.9.9.3
- scl_feed_override bug at start up,
  did not handle G0 Override correct, 
  thanks to Marius for reporting that bug 

ver. 0.9.9.9.2
- scl_feed_override did not take influence on G0 velocities
  now it will take influence G1 and G0 velocities

ver. 0.9.9.9.1
- there was a bug in tool touch off, discovered by Jim
  solved that

ver. 0.9.9.9
- gmoccapy is now able to do auto tool measurement after an manual tool change
- introduced a ini config to simulate that
- still to do: If user clickes on aboart while the tool change message window is still open
  or he closes the window with the small X on the right upper corner, the hal pin will
  not be reste propery

ver. 0.9.9.8.2
- gmoccapy_plasma, changed pin names to follow the pin naming convention
- included THC Button state in persistaence (plasma.var)

ver. 0.9.9.8.1
- self.data.jog_increments now is self.jog_increments
  changed the increments handling a little bit
  so there is no need any more for self.no_increments
- changed code from self.gscreen.halcomp to self.halcomp, because it is the same ;-)
- prepared to be able to get an gmoccapy hal component

ver. 0.9.9.8
- bug in jogging with buttons and SHIFT hold down, as that would
  result in a move at max velocity, not taking in care the max vel slider
- renamed self.data.ob to self.onboard_kb to make code clearer
- self.data.plot_view was a relict from gscreen, because gscreen needs to toggle 
  through the views, we can select them directly, so this data is gone now
- self.data.hide_cursor is now self.hide_cursor so this is different to gscreen, so 
  both GUI should not influence each other
- self.data.key_event_last changed to self.last_key_event (distinguish from gscreen)
- corrected some typo in release notes
- self.data.file replaced with self.stat.file, as it is not necessary to hold that on data
- self.data.estopped replaced with self.stat.task_state
- self.data.machine_on replaced with self.stat.task_state
- self.data.all_homed is now self.all_homed so I know that this value is not set from gscreen
- self.data.spindle_speed and self.data.spindle_direction replaced with self.stat statemenets
- self.data.flood and self.data.mist replaced with stat statements
- self.data.active_feed replaced with stat statements, resulting in auto units change also for
  the speed labels
- self.data.diameter_mode is now self.diameter_mode so its clear it come from gmoccapy
- gremlin does react now on auto_units behavior of Combi_DRO
- all sliders (scales) change according to active Gcode G20 / G21
- executing an MDI command will change the keyboard button to allow linuxcnc.aboart()

ver. 0.9.9.7.6
- solved the bug wrong units on start up without the preference file
  I needed to replace gscreen.status with my my own status, because gscreen 
  does deliver wrong values!
- changed some more gscreen.data stuff to self.stat..., 
  because IMHO it is not necessary to use data to store something what is available
  through stat module
- replaced the preference file handling from gscreen to an own one, expecting that
  gscreen does not mess my files up, if no preference file will be given in the INI,
  we will use gmoccapy.pref stored in the config folder, so there could be different 
  configs with different settings 
- don't need gscreen.emc any more, all is done now directly with the linuxcnc python bindings
- I do not use any more the gscreen.ini, we use now the linuxcnc.ini version from the python module

ver. 0.9.9.7.5
- typo in initialize_preferences 
- deleted the statusbar widget
- no more option to use gscreen error handling
- no more option to use desktop notify
- the optional stops button worked opposite it should
- renamed some stuff from emc to linuxcnc or shortened the names
- onboard keyboard showing in edit mode corrected
- plasma.py changed order of getting widgets from builder, 
  to avoid errors at load time
- notification change line wrap mode to character, 
  so longer file names will not be cut

ver. 0.9.9.7.4
- the default tool change dialog now shows 
  the tool number and the tool description
- after deleting the preferences file you get an error starting the GUI, 
  because it tried to load a file " ", I deleted the SPACE to solve that

ver. 0.9.9.7.3
- plasma screen now hide also the vel_info_box
- minimal changes on the glade files
- modified the plasma.py file to support persistence variables
  the settings will be stored in plasma.var in your config dir
- I set the plasma.py file under GPL license

ver. 0.9.9.7.2
- introduced an better gcode highlight for sourceview

ver. 0.9.9.7.1
- replaced the hal_scale_jog_vel with a normal scale,
  as there is no need for a additional hal pin
- renamed hal pin 
  gscreen.hal_hbar_spindle_feedback to be gscreen.spindle_feedback_bar
  gscreen.hal_led_spindle_at_speed to be gscreen.spindle_at_speed_led
  This way all spindle pins are together in halshow 

ver. 0.9.9.7
- make gmoccapy react to external mode changes, i.e. start program with
  net start halui.mode.auto => halui.program.run <= hardware.button

ver. 0.9.9.6.3
- changed again the plasma layout, as Marius still want more widgets
- most hal labels are not needed any more, so I changed them to gtk.label

ver- 0.9.9.6.2
- added a lot of hal pin to gmoccapy_plasma, with the new 
  plasma.py file 
- reworked the plasma.glade file to fit Marius needs
- new order of configs, many files have been moved by Dewey Garret

ver. 0.9.9.6.1
- solved a bug in plasma.py, having a call without function

ver. 0.9.9.6
- made a new config folder to show gmoccapy as plasma screen
- included some minor changes to be able to place user glade panels 
  over the coolant and spindle frame, hiding the original widgets
  so plasma screen can easy be realized
  This will hide also the spindle speed label in gcode info frame.
- the tool info frame can also be hidden by a user glade file, because tool
  info is not needed for plasma.
- corrected an error in handling python calls in / for user glade screens,
  as example introduced plasma.glade plasma.hal and plasma.py demonstrating
  all possible communications

ver. 0.9.9.5
- added color chooser for homed and unhomed colors, as recommended
  by BigJohnT to help people suffering from protanopia (red/green weakness)
- corrected an error updating the DRO colors in lathe mode

ver. 0.9.9.4
- initializing some warnings at start up, corrected that
- deleted some unneeded print messages

ver. 0.9.9.3
- if the user tried to make a new file and there where no 
  RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE in the INI file, an exception has been thrown
  fixed that bug
- if the user tried to make a new file, after he made already one,
  an exception has been thrown, because the file was loaded already
  fixed that bug

ver. 0.9.9.2
- solved a bug, entering the edit mode from auto mode, caused by 
  a typo in a widget name

ver. 0.9.9.1
- solved a bug showing the gremlin DRO, caused by a typo in a widget name
- some buttons and widgets did not have tooltip text, added that ones
- corrected German translation
- corrected Spanish translation

ver. 0.9.9
- introduced a new DRO, showing all three positions (Abs, Rel, DTG) at ones
  user can toggle the DRO by clicking on them
- The new DRO also indicates the actual coordinate system
- The new DRO will change its units according to the active gcode (G20 / G21)
- There are still the three buttons, but they are hidden by default,
  this can be changed on the settings page, but when the buttons are visible,
  the user looses the auto units feature of the DRO
  Hope too get the permission from the users to delete that button as soon as possible
- made the documentation for IconViewFileSelection
- made the documentation for Combi_DRO
- This change saved some lines of code in gmoccapy.py and made the code
  a lot easier to understand
- updated German translation
- updated Spanish translation

ver. 0.9.8.4
- diameter dro does not show imperial units, even if machine units are imperial, fixed.
- tool info only with three digits in imperial mode, now 4 digits
- active feed and active vel label not in machine units, if in imperial mode, fixed
- cosmetic changes to gmoccapy_lathe.ini
- introduced a imperial lathe ini

ver 0.9.8.3
- BUG: forget to update the coordinate system after changing the error system,
  causing the ABS/REL button not showing the correct label, fixed
- BUG: inserted Jog Increment continuous instead of 0, so could cause an exception
  on translated GUI, fixed
- BUG: when changing the mode from outside, i.e. starting a program with an external button, 
  the GUI did not change the style to auto mode, so it was not consistent, fixed
- deleted unnecessary icon and introduced new icon for machine on off and for the
  mode button (Thanks to Dejan/probamo)

ver. 0.9.8.2
- make the design from spindle and coolant frames more beautiful
- added both to a hbox, so later this box may be replaced by user controls,
  i.e. plasma cutters

ver. 0.9.8.1
- introduced new Serbian translation

ver. 0.9.8
- introduced notification as gmoccapy error messaging system
- rebuild the settings page to make the message system settings available
- new default startup position
- changed DRO textcolor label to DRO background color label, because that is what you change
- jogging with keyboard will jog full speed if SHIFT is hold down
- <Super_L> key will delete the last message of gmoccapy message system
- <STRG>+<SPACE> delete all gmoccapy messages at once
- switching on the machine will reset the GUI to manual mode
- the setup button is no longer a member of the mode radiobuttons
  it is now a toggle button, so pressing it twice will bring
  you to manual mode

ver. 0.9.7.5.1
- missed to change the version number in gmoccapy_handler.py
  corrected that

ver. 0.9.7.5
- translation of the Continuous Jog Button now possible
- solved a bug, when selecting the continuous jog button when it was translated
- added ABS, DTG and GTD to translation file
- added "show or hide tool path" to translation
- corrected a bug changing spindle bar min and max values changed the widget only on restart
- added to translation the complete gscreen.py file, even if there are a lot of things 
  nobody need to translate, but that gives the possibility to translate the entry dialogs 
  and some button labels

ver. 0.9.7.4
- added the Serbian translation
- corrected some mistakes in Spanish translation
- moved some files to get them in the corresponding locale folder
- modified .gitignore files so my locale folder will not be ignored any more

ver. 0.9.7.3.1
- removed some print/debug lines
- new order of the button in Auto Mode (requested from svenakela)
- corrected some translation errors
- changed the order of the jog button and the DRO, now when jogging on a touch screen, the
  right hand will not cover the DRO. Better handling?!
- deleted the button reload from auto to get space for fullsize_preview, so the user can switch to
  fullsize preview, while the program runs.
- errased the close button in bottom button list edit, because the back button does the same 
- corrected the hardware button behavior, was needed because of the new order and 
  the reason that not "clicked" is emitted, but "pressed"
- button edit offsets now shows automatically the offset page

- bugfix on macro goto position caused from self.on_btn_macro_pressed()
- finshed the hal connections also for the vertical buttons
  to test with simulated buttons, you have to uncomment the coresponing lines in INI and postgui.hal
  then two buttonlist will aperear
- There was a problem excecuting the macros with the hardware button, 
  user where able to start a second macro while the first was still running, solved that

  to test the features, just uncomment 3 lines in INI File DISPLAY section, see comments there
  and uncomment the connections made in gmoccapy_postgui.hal
  I need someone to test this with real hardware, as with gladevcp buttons there seems to be
  a problem with the mode settings, change a tool with M61 will not bring you back in manual mode 
  using the software keys, due to gladevcp in my opinion.
