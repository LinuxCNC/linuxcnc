ver 2.3.5
- jogging a not homed machine did change the button state of MDI and AUTO to be
  sensitive, what is not correct.
- it was not possible to jog a unhomed machine over the given limits, what is 
  not a correct behavior.

ver 2.3.4.2
- introduced new keyboard shortcuts (not case sensitive)
  R = run program
  P = pause program
  S = resume program
  This keys will only work in auto mode, not being in edit mode and 
  a program must be loaded. Pause and resume do only work if a 
  program is running and / or paused.

ver 2.3.4.1
- Philippe mentioned that a change of the DRO Size on settings page will be
  saved as expected, but after new start of the GUI, the value did note be
  restored properly. I have corrected the behavior

ver 2.3.4
- Leon82 mentioned, that offset page did close after editing a column and leaving
  the edited cell. This was caused due to a hidden mode change to MDI because
  leaving the cell would apply the change using MDI commands from 
  offset page_widget.py. Gmoccapy now checks the state of the "EDIT OFFSETS" 
  toggle button and does not react to MDI Mode switch if that button is active.
  at the same time, the mode buttons etc. are disabled!
  
  Same changes as with gmoccapy 1.5.11

ver 2.3.3.4
- a merge of 2.7 to master resulted in a call of a widget, that does not longer
  exist in master (adj_max_velocity) causing an exception on halui pin changes.
  Thanks to COlger81 and Chris Morley for reporting the bug

ver 2.3.3.3
- editing offsets, leaded to a error output in the console, due to missing
  widget btn_zero_x

ver 2.3.3.2
- toggling the chk_toggle_readout, raised an exception on 5 axis config

ver 2.3.3.1
- small changes to the code, as there was a possibility the
  label was shown, even if auto tool measurement was not used

ver 2.3.3
- added a label at the button of the preview window to show the actual 
  block-height value
- the value is stored in the preference file and will be reloaded on start up,
  the corresponding hal pin is set to that value
- the block-height label is only visible, if the "use auto tool measurement" 
  check-box is active!

  Thanks to Rubenv and crislacuf for reporting

ver 2.3.2.4
- most of .format code rework done

ver 2.3.2.3
- display message as dialog, when critical errors do avoid the start of gmoccapy
  not only report in terminal

ver 2.3.2.2
- ongoing reformatting the code to new .format style

ver 2.3.2.1
- formating bug in Vc, when over 100, float can not be formated as int

ver 2.3.2
- added a new label to toolinfo box, showing the cutting speed Vc
  it uses the tool diameter on mill and the x-relative value for lathe
- first code updates to the new string formating (not % but .format),
  as this will be needed to switch over to python 3

ver 2.3.1.9
- dialogs, changed entry_dialog check for integer before show_all
  This was only a cosmetic change
- Solved bug in lathe mode, changing the size of DRO, did not 
  change the Y DRO (D). Thanks to Partic T for reporting

ver 2.3.1.8
- made dialogs a Class and enable gobject signals with the dialogs
  Now a sound will be played if a dialog pops up.

  This is a first step to modify all the handling within the GUI to
  make most parts react to signal and slots.

ver 2.3.1.7
- minor bug in self periodic, forgot to change an AUDIO_AVIABLE setting
- some work on tool handling, i.e. not possible to delete tool in spindle
  any more and after applying changes the tool in spindle will be marked

ver 2.3.1.6
- solved the bug, that the decimal separator was changed after starting the gui
  the was related to the import of gst, as this import does change the value of
  locale.localeconv()["decimal_point"]
  I do not know why, but the import of gst prior to locale settings solves the problem

ver 2.3.1.5
- some code clearance, as the tooleditor stuff was reparted on several places
  Now it is together in _init_tooleditor.
  This is the begining of finding the bug of decimal separator handling
  Push reload will replace the German "," with the "." Why = ?????

ver 2.3.1.4
- if no sound is available make the sound selecting widgets on the settings page
  not sensitive, Thanks to Rene for reporting this misbehavior

ver 2.3.1.3
- changed the import of the player module, as Stretch does not support gst in
  the way Wheesy or Jessie did

ver 2.3.1.2
- rodw reported that gmoccapy reported a wrong error if JOINT was mentioned
  in the error report. That was caused due to an old change from Joints to axis
  in _show_errors.

ver 2.3.1.1
- added KeyPad Jogging as a wish from "suspension" from the forum

ver 2.3.1
- added a new hal pin for tool diameter

ver 2.3.0
- joint axis branch did change the handling between joints and axis. Previously
  it was needed to include a unused Y axis for a lathe and now that is not longer
  needed. There are some more changes, that needed some additional changes to
  gmoccapy. I have passed a lot of code over to get_ini_info.
- all config files have been changed to support the new behavior. I tried to make
  all the code compatible with older configs. Some might need the not used axis
  to be included in homing entries in the ini files.

ver 2.2.5.2
- if the GUI tries to reload a tool on restart and that tool was not found in 
  the tool table, the GUI remained in MDI mode, while it was showing the manual 
  view. This leaded to the problem, that jogging was not possible, but users 
  thought they where in MANUAL mode, where jogging should be allowed.

ver 2.2.5.1
- added a new dictionary self.joint_axis_dic to maintain the relation between 
  joints and axis. This was tested with gantry and non identical configs. There
  might be configs out there witch won't work with gmoccapy.
  I found that the only way to get gantry XYYZ and i.e. XYZCW config to work
  with the homing button and the DRO settings

ver 2.2.5
- this repairs the parts I broke on glade applications and the former used
  code in CombiDRO moved in a similar mode to gmoccapy. Now after the merge of
  sequential homing branch it is easier to use a gantry config with gmoccapy.
  There is still need to adapt the "on_btn_homing_selected" part of the GUI, as
  now a XYZC config will not allow homing of C, as the joints are not ordered
  correctly

ver 2.2.4
- introduced a check for double axis letters in [TRAJ]COORDINATES = X Y Y Z 
  to set the homing button of the double mentioned axis. This is to protect 
  a gantry from being damaged homing only one joint of two.
  Thanks to rodw for insisting to solve the misbehavior

ver 2.2.3.3
- check on homing for double letters and get the correct joint number
  for homing

ver 2.2.3.2
- solved a bug caused due to an unappropriated merge of Sebastian Kuzminski
  causing a hal pin to be created twice.

ver 2.2.3.1
- solved the reload tool on start up bug after homing twice
  if there is already a tool in spindle, the user 
  homed the second time, unfortunately we will then
  not get out of MDI mode any more
  That happen, because the tool in spindle did not change, so the 
  tool info is not updated and we self.change_tool will not be reseted
  Thanks to timmert for reporting

ver. 2.2.3
- added patch from gmoccapy 1.5.7
- new hal pin gmoccapy.ignore-limits so that this function can be
  handled from hardware switch
  Ask by some users, done because of a wish of Timothy Snowden
  
ver. 2.2.2
- When running a program, press pause, then stop, the axis will make a jump to 
  a unknown position, (I think related to read ahead). I added a additional 
  command.aboard(), even that this command is already called within hal action.
  I do not know why, but this solved the issue as far as I can see.
  Thanks to racedirector for reporting

ver. 2.2.1
- if linuxcnc is restarted without shutting down gmoccapy, it was not possible
  to close gmoccapy (except from comandline with killall -9 gmoccapy
  I added a check to status.poll and now a raise SystemExit will be called.
  as this also applies to CombiDRO a added that there too.
  I added gmoccapy to the linuxcnc script to be killed on restart

ver. 2.2.0.3
- changed the height and width adjustments for the window size in the 
  glade file, as width was limited to 1280 pixel. 
  Now the max limit is 3920 pixel.

ver. 2.2.0.2
- if no MACROS was given in INI file, the getiniinfo returns a NONE,
  leading to an exception in gmoccapy, corrected that

ver. 2.2.0.1
- make the reload tool option a selectable feature on the
  settings page. It will be on by default!

ver. 2.2.0
- gmoccapy will save the tool in spindle on every change in its
  preference file and reload that tool with it's length offset
  till now only tested for mill!
  This will not work if NO_FORCE_HOMING is used, because with such
  a configuration the signal "all_homed" will not be emitted.

ver. 2.1.6.5
- changed the expanding way of the widgets in the INFO box
  to better appearance on 16:9 screens, the tool info will 
  not grow alone, but also spindle and vel info boxes

ver. 2.1.6.4
- Added the patch from ver. 1.5.6.9
    * if no MACROS where given, or the paths where not correct, the Keyboard button
      in MDI mode was not any more in the most right position, leading to wrong
      order in horizontal hal button handling

ver. 2.1.6.3
- Dawey Garret changed the init_glcanondraw() behavior, making
  some changes in gmoccapy and getiniinfo. That is why I changed the 
  release number

ver. 2.1.6.2
- better solution for the G96 bug

ver. 2.1.6.1
- bug handling of G96 CSS, related to the update of the
  real spindle speed label
  Thanks to Hakan for reporting this
- Jumping spindle speed label due to a calculation error between
  two functions, and double setting of a label, Solved!

ver. 2.1.6
- merged the changes I made to 1.5.6.5 to 1.5.6.8
  details see below

ver. 2.1.5
- halui spindle override bug, caused by a race conflict
  Thanks to pippin88 and dinkata to help solving his one

ver. 2.1.4
- lathe wear offsets has been displayed by default, IMHO that
  disturbs most users, as the wear offsets do only work with
  remaped code. That part is only weak documented.
- If the user wants to use wear offsets, he will have to include
  in [DISPLAY] LATHE_WEAR_OFFSETS = 1, otherwise the additional tabs
  will be hidden.

ver. 2.1.3
- mode change was possible with keyboard shortcuts, even if the 
  interpreter was running.
- if the user changed with keyboard shortcut a mode and after that to
  an other mode with button, it was not possible to change to the 
  previous mode with the keyboard shortcut, as the last key event 
  is recorded. Now the hal status event will reset the key event
 
ver. 2.1.2
- spindle label besides the 100 % button has not been updated

ver. 2.1.1
- starting with estop-reset, caused some errors, because it is not 
  possible to JOG_STOP with machine in OFF state

ver. 2.1.0
- reworked Combi_DRO to fit the needs of JA requierements
- some configs must be adapted to the new hal pin names, as they are
  put together in groups, so all stuff with jog is in that group
- Hiding the jog button in world mode is possible with a command line argument
- reorderd some code to be more understandable
- deleted a lot of debug prints
- still having problems with matchbox-keyboard, it is found, but not shown
  on every config, need more testing.

ver.2.0.26
- bugfix: if toggle button user tabs was active and the user changed the mode
  (Manual,MDI or AUTO) the user tabs button staid active, but the screen
  layout changed to the corresponding mode, letting the button pressed.
- if embedded tabs was set in the INI file, the toggle button user tabs
  got active, even if no tab was configured for "ntb_user_tabs", changed this
  and sorted the code to be together with the rest of user tabs
- error in getiniinfo.get_increments, default values contained "," insteadt "."

ver.2.0.25.1
- some changes to support new homing by joints, not by axis
  still work to do!
- do not allow any more the change to mdi or auto in Joint Mode!
 
ver.2.0.25
- introduced hal pin to jog joints, make sure not to
  allow joint jogging in world mode and vice versa
- renamed most hal pin, so they are better organized, 
  kept together in groups
- big bug in all homed signal of hal_glib avoid pushing to master

ver. 2.0.24
- reduced digits of velocity label to 2 digits for imperial

ver. 2.0.23
- bug in _update_slider, caused by units change and the needed
  recalculation of jog_vel

ver. 2.0.22
- corrected the reading of preferences, under some circumstances
  as bool written settings, couldn't be read correct from file,
  leading to wrong settings. This is a known bug in ConfigParser.
  I went over to write all bool settings as string, this way it 
  works like a charm. At the same time all bool values must be 
  read with type = bool!

ver. 2.0.21
- added Joint Jog Button, _init_joints_btn will show only 
  the needed button, so from now on gmoccapy supports 8 Joints
  and 5 axis
- still problems with the initialization of optional stops
- some button renaming to distinguish joints and axis jog button
  due to special case 4th and 5th axis
- reworked on_jog_btn_pressed and released to support joint jogging
  could be done better, will need some additional rework
- deleted some print messages

ver. 2.0.20
- small bug in _reset_override in rapid handling, 
  as it would reset to 100 % on change to any state, 
  instead only on pin.get()

ver. 2.0.19
- deleted the settings to hide axis 4 if used as tool changer
  as that is not longer needed on Joint Axis branch
- corrected a DRO display issue on 4 axis config
- deleted unneeded handlers for axis touch off to zero

ver. 2.0.18
- deleted adj_jog_vel and use spc_jog_vel
- If a user uses analog input signals 
  (i.e. gmoccapy.jog-speed.analog-enable) the 100 % button will be hidden
  as pushing this buttons will lead to unsynchronized state between GUI and
  hardware. Also the turtle and rabbit jog velocities can not be different
  in there percentage, as the can be using a jog wheel.
  we will also hide the plus and minus button of the widgets, as they also
  can not be used together with analog input
- changed pin name from jog-speed to jog-velocity
- changed back the override frames to original order

ver. 2.0.17
- deleted adj_feed and use spc_feed
- corrected a strange way of updating spindle override values
- corrected a lot of typos within this file and gmoccapy.py

ver. 2.0.16
- deleted adj_rapid_override and use spc_rapid

ver. 2.0.15
- finally found a way to avoid jumping DRO size of axis 4 and 5
  if the amount of numbers change, i.e. from 99.999 to 100.001
  as it need more space.
- added a togglebutton to switch from joint to teleop, this button 
  will be hidden on identity kinematics machines
- small bug in spc_spinlde handling 
  (to many get and set leaded to jumping values)

ver. 2.0.14
- deleted adj_spinlde and changes the code to use directly the settings
  of the SpeedControl widget. This way we save resources, because we
  need one adjustment less. I will change the code also for the rest of
  the sliders.

ver. 2.0.13
- updated debug server to use newest version on my computer

ver. 2.0.12
- bug in touchscreen slider if machine units and display units not equal
- corrected some strange entries in ini files

ver. 2.0.11
- some small changes in INI configs
- changed the DRO Size settings depending on number of axis
- set the init_colors of the combi DRO to hex values instead of names
  like green, as different desktops do interpret the names with 
  different color values
 
ver. 2.0.10
- jog vel touchscreen slider was not initialized with the correct 
  increment due to a type in a variable
- changed some default values in the INI file of 4 axis gmoccapy.ini

ver. 2.0.9
- added some 5 axis IDENTITY kinematics sim configs

ver. 2.0.8
- 4 axis config did not hide y replace label, leading to 
  touch of button being to nerow

ver. 2.0.7
- bug in key handling of F12 (switch mode)
  as mode was also changed in IDENTITY kinematics
- bug in _init_extra_axes

ver. 2.0.6
- corrected some small bugs, avoiding gremlin to switch 
  to full-size preview,
- got back some missing handlers in the glade file

ver. 2.0.5
- merged with the touchscreen slider version
- deleted unneeded INI entries
- Attention: Hal pin names have changed during change from 1.n to 2.0

ver. 2.0.4
- merged with the gmoccapy JA version

ver. 2.0.3
- bug in DRO size handling

ver. 2.0.2
- added user mode as command line argument
- added logo as command line argument

ver. 2.0.1
- when using hardware button to jog the axis, the 5th axis wath not 
  recognized, resulting in a jog of the 4th axis. I solved this bug
  and introduced a new config to test this.
  Thanks to Ludwig for reporting the bug

ver. 2.0.0
- initial push of beta gmoccapy with 5 axis

ver. 1.5.11
- Leon82 mentioned, that offset page did close after editing a column and leaving
  the edited cell. This was caused due to a hidden mode change to MDI because
  leaving the cell would apply the change using MDI commands from 
  offset page_widget.py. Gmoccapy now checks the state of the "EDIT OFFSETS" 
  toggle button and does not react to MDI Mode switch if that button is active.
  at the same time, the mode buttons etc. are disabled!

ver. 1.5.10
- fixed a misbehavior of the turtle button
  If machine and system units was not identical, the turtle button destroyed
  the values set on the jog vel slider
  thanks to sliptonic from linuxcnc forum
- while moving the max vel slider and units of machine and system not being 
  identical, results in a jumping slider, as the factor has not been taken in 
  account on the halui pin checking

ver. 1.5.9
- fixed a bug on import gst, leading to an exception if gst is not installed
- fixed a bug, not taking care of Y-DRO (D) in lathe mode if the user changed
  the size of the DRO

ver. 1.6.0
- changed the initial sound files to fit freedesktop path
  was set to ubuntu till now
- first steps to support teleop mode
  Homing is possible as gantry and as identity kinematics
  Jogging is possible in both modes
  Mode change can be done pressing F12 or $
  the mode is displayed with the gremlin view DRO, combi DRO will not change jet.
- ToDo: * Add widget to change motion mode
        * Init GUI to have a jog button per joint and not only per axis
        * change GUI appearance according to motion mode

ver. 1.5.7
- new hal pin gmoccapy.ignore-limits so that this function can be
  handled from hardware switch
  Ask by some users, done because of a wish of Timothy Snowden

ver. 1.5.6.10
- if no MARCO was found in INI getiniinfo returned a NONE, leading to an
  exception in gmoccapy, corrected that.

ver. 1.5.6.9
- if no MACROS where given, or the paths where not correct, the Keyboard button
  in MDI mode was not any more in the most right position, leading to wrong
  order in horizontal hal button handling
 
ver. 1.5.6.8
- gmoccapy poll time for the GUI was hard coded till now, I changed that
  to take care of the INI File settings. If no or a wrong entry is in the 
  INI file a default value of 150 will be used.

ver. 1.5.6.7
- reading of subroutine paths did not take care of ":" separeted paths
  so it was not possible to use NativeCAM together with gmoccapy macros
  I corrected that misbehavior of gmoccapy. That change was used to
  clear some macro code and I transfered some checking to get_ini_info

ver. 1.5.6.6
- check at start if there is a INI entry for DEFAULT_SPINDLE_SPEED
  and set the gmoccapy settings accordingly.

ver. 1.5.6.5
- merged the bug fix from 2.6 branch gmoccapy 1.5.6.2.2

ver. 1.5.6.4
- bugfix: if toggle button user tabs was active and the user changed the mode
  (Manual,MDI or AUTO) the user tabs button staid active, but the screen
  layout changed to the corresponding mode, letting the button pressed.
- if embedded tabs was set in the INI file, the toggle button user tabs 
  got active, even if no tab was configured for "ntb_user_tabs", changed this
  and sorted the code to be together with the rest of user tabs

ver. 1.5.6.3
- bugfix: In _init_IconFileSelection the icon size was fixed with 48 
  so changes the user makes to the glade file was not been taken care of
- In glade file a signal on_btn_load_state_changed was set, but no handler present, 
  leading to a error message on start in the terminal, erased the signal

ver. 1.5.6.2.3
- bug in handling a subroutine call from MDI, containing 
  G96 code. Thanks to Hakan for reporting this.

ver. 1.5.6.2.2
- halui spindle override bug, caused by a race conflict
  Thanks to pippin88 and dinkata to help solving his one

ver. 1.5.6.2.1
- bug in initialize optional stops

ver. 1.5.6.2
- bugfix: run from line was trying to set an entry in the alarm page, whitch
  I dropped in 1.5.6 
  I cleared the code from unneeded imports and comments

ver. 1.5.6.1
- bugfix: If a user did jog with keyboard and while jogging changed the increments
  pressing "i" on the keyboard the jog move would never stop. I do check now for
  self.stat.state and do avoid that way the increment changes
  if the user changes the jog-increment using the hal pin, the increment will change
  to the new value, but the jog command will be aborted.
- corrected some typos 

ver. 1.5.6
- deleted the alarm_entry log page, as it has not been used by users
  to report bugs, and therefor it was designed.
- changing DRO mode by click can be disabled on settings page
- corrected and added information to the docs
- added a new property to combi_dro to disable readout toggling

ver. 1.5.5.5
- if using gmoccapy jog hal pin in MDI mode a error was thrown on button release
- Typo in settings page, corrected also the translation files

ver. 1.5.5.4
- corrected a error shown on start up, because I used greeen instead of green
- glade file did contain a signal "on_gremlin_clicked", but gmoccapy did not offer a handler,
  resulting in error messages in the terminal on start up. the unneeded signal has been erased
- The horizontal buttons of gmoccapy will stay synchronized with the iconview widget
 
ver. 1.5.5.3
- deleted the working area limit pin, as this can be realized better
  with standard hal pin and did not work well with gmoccapy
- settings page, all previous settings are now in one frame
- updated the documentation
- new serbian translation files, and corrected the language code 
  was rs.po instead sr.po

ver. 1.5.5.2
- unloading a tool with M61 Q0 did not reset the tool information 
  because the tool number changed to "-1" and I tested only for "0"
  To unload the tool with M61 Q0 the command has to be executed twice
  because of a linuxcnc bug (IMHO)

ver. 1.5.5.1
- corrected the step by step behavior

ver. 1.5.5
- gmoccapy will take notice of the settings 
  "DISPLAY", "POSITION_FEEDBACK" in the INI File and 
  set the DRO accordingly (Code basis from Steffen)
- Added keyboard shortcut F3 to change to manual mode
- Added keyboard shortcut F5 to change to MDI Mode
- Added keyboard shortcut "Enter" for MDI Mode to 
  submit the selected command
- Added keyboard shortcut "i" and "I" to switch 
  jog increments forward and backwards like in axis

ver. 1.5.4.1
- changed full-size preview button in manual mode to new position
  to be the same place in auto and manual mode.

ver. 1.5.4
- changing in auto mode, being in full-size preview to edit page leaded
  to blank screen, I corrected that bug.

ver. 1.5.3.1
- solved a bug in widget handling, not enabling the ignore limits checkbox,
  being on a limit switch

ver. 1.5.3
- added a gscreen patch to search also in the user dir for themes

ver. 1.5.2.2
- if a user did reduce spindle override to zero and switched on the 
  spindle, gmoccapy produced a division by zero error. Fixed!
  reported by "tekmobile"

ver. 1.5.2.1
- corrected a bug on btn_brake_macro, not being active if no virtual
  keyboard has been installed
  Thanks to Frans (franstrein) for reporting

ver. 1.5.2
- In Lathe mode and with startcode G7 the DRO has not been set
  correctly, while starting in G8 was OK.
- Some code clearance 

ver. 1.5.1.4
- Two missing self. leaded to errors if logging was active, 
  Thanks to Frans (franstrein) for reporting

ver. 1.5.1.3
- As in full screen mode the GUI covers also the clock, I added a clock
  and date label under the right buttons. 

ver. 1.5.1.2
- The handler from glade_status <on_change_line> got lost somehow, so 
  some hal pin has not been updated correctly  
- in the glade file the spindle at speed led changed its color to red,
  I don't know how, I think glade is coming to its limit ;-)
- changed spindle label handling, now the labels display actual values, 
  not the read values.
- The spindle buttons will now be sensitive in auto mode, but only the
  one witch is active, so spindle direction is displayed clearly  

ver. 1.5.1.1
- some print commands has been commented out to avoid to much condole infos
- there was a limit of 100 for tool sensor height, I extended to 999 mm

ver. 1.5.1
- solved a bug in counts handling, if only one MPG was used for 
  all sliders and axis, there was a jump after changing the selection
  Now it does not matter, if the user connect only one MPG or use for
  each slider an own MPG 

ver. 1.5.0
- new hal pin, and some renaming of hal pin to reflect the
  same names and behavior as halui-pin

  * gmoccapy.jog-speed.counts
  * gmoccapy.jog-speed.analog-enable
  * gmoccapy.jog-speed.count-enable
  * gmoccapy.jog-speed.direct-value

  * gmoccapy.feed-override.counts
  * gmoccapy.feed-override.analog-enable
  * gmoccapy.feed-override.count-enable
  * gmoccapy.feed-override.direct-value

  * gmoccapy.spindle-override.counts
  * gmoccapy.spindle-override.analog-enable
  * gmoccapy.spindle-override.count-enable
  * gmoccapy.spindle-override.direct-value

  * gmoccapy.max-velocity.counts
  * gmoccapy.max-velocity.count-enable
  * gmoccapy.max-velocity.analog-enable
  * gmoccapy.max-velocity.direct-value

- gmoccapy will now react to some halui pin as counts or direct value
  Be aware, that some of this may have side affects, it is strongly 
  recomended to use the corresponding gmoccapy hal pin. 

  * halui.spindle-override.counts
  * halui.feed-override.counts
  * halui.max-velocity.counts
  * halui.abort
  * halui.spindle.start
  * halui.spindle.stop
  * halui.spindle.reverse
  * halui.spindle.increase
  * halui.spindle.decrease
  * halui.program.run
  * halui.program.stop
  * halui.program.pause
  * halui.mode.manual

- to reflect the new hal pin connections I introduced a new sim config 
  gmoccapy_pendant.ini, demonstrating the connection of a remote pendant 
  with selection switches

- deleted gmoccapy_jog_wheels.ini, as pendant.ini demonstrates it better

ver. 1.4.2
- removed the save and run button from the edit page, 
  because of security reasons
- removed the integrated terminal, as it was not real usefull
  and all terminal work can be done from normal terminal
- translations for German and Spanish has been updated

ver. 1.4.1
- corrected broken layout style, as the jog-increment buttons has not 
  been modified to change there background color, getting only dark grey 
  instead of yellow, if they where active. No the follow the gmoccapy style.
- the number of digits of the DRO can now be set on the settings page, so 
  users of fragile machines can reduce the digits.

ver. 1.4.0
- introduced turtle jog, allowing two scales for the 
  jog vel adjustment
- new hal pin "gmoccapy.turtle-jog" to switch from rabbit-jog 
  (fast mode) to turtle-jog (slow mode) using a hardware switch
- new hal pin for analog input 
  * gmoccapy.analog-enable (must be True to activate the analog inputs)
  * gmoccapy.spindle-override-value
  * gmoccapy.max-vel-value
  * gmoccapy.jog-speed-value
  * gmoccapy.feed-override-value
  all four taking a float input as percentage, 
  meaning a value from 0.0 to 1.0, setting the corresponding slider
  directly to the given value
- some code rework, mainly in the _init_hal_pin section and on 
  encoder counts handling 

ver. 1.3.5.1
- forgot to reset the gcode error, resulting in showing it only once,
  it ws not shown again if a good file was loaded and than again the 
  wrong one, now the load and edit button do reset the error code. 

ver. 1.3.5
- added the new signal from hal_gremlin to gmoccapy so we do get 
  a message of gcode errors when loading a file and not only when
  the interpreter does read the wrong line. A warning box will inform 
  about the error details.

ver. 1.3.4
- if no virtual keyboard was installed (nor onboard or matchbox),
  the checkboxes on the settings page has not been sensitized and the
  settings has not been reseted correctly from the preference file
  Thanks to Roland (concierge) for finding this one

ver. 1.3.3
- the combobox for the mouse button mode has not been initialized
  correct, if it had the default value of the glade file. It is a 
  bug in glade. The work around is not to set a default value in glade
  but in the python code.

ver. 1.3.2
- fixed a small bug PAUSE button did not get active on M01
  Thanks to Rick (LAIR82) for pointing on it.

ver. 1.3.1
- fixed very serious bug PAUSE / RESUME / STOP issue
  Program jumped to strange positions if STOP has been pressed 
  while PAUSE was active.
  Thanks to Mael (papaours) for finding it.

ver. 1.3.0.1
- corrected a bug, toolchange velocity hal pin have not been
  preseted with values, if the user worked with the
  default values, so a probing with vel = 0 was possible, 
  resulting in an error
- corrected an error in notifications.py, as the text to be
  displayed has not been checked for correct pango format, a
  message like "vel <= 0" resulted in an error. Now the necessary 
  check is done

ver. 1.3.0
- added replace function to the edit page
- added ignore case to allow case sensitive search
- added reload button on edit page, so if you 
  mixed up to much, you are able to reload the
  original file
- corrected an error at start up, giving a button
  a label, conflicting with a button label
- changed a wrong icon on the button go up one directory

ver. 1.2.2
- changed the way the window size and position is 
  handled, as before the default values did appear 
  several times in the code
- If no virtual keyboard could be initialized, we 
  disable now the corresponding part on the settings
  page and the related button. Check will be done
  for <onboard> and <matchbox-keyboard>
- starting gmoccapy did throw an error to the terminal
  that a widget could not get default. Finally I found 
  the reason, the glade file did contain a property
  "has_default" and that is not allowed by builder.

ver. 1.2.1
- due to the behavior of XFCE of the new hybrid.iso I 
  had to change the width settings of several button
  to stretch them to fit some text and images
- The same reason forced to set new default start position
  of the main window and the notification messages.

ver. 1.2.0
- changed GetIniInfo to return also user message setups
- notification now supports pango markup in the messages
- added hal user messages similar to gsreeen to gmoccapy
  see gmoccapy_messages.ini for usage information
- updated the translation files for German and Spanish 

ver. 1.1.5.9
- prepared yesno_dialog for user message, 
  it does accept now pango markup
- wrong values in axis offset didn't show a message
  to the user, I fixed that

ver. 1.1.5.8
- message at start because of
  return(PlasmaClass(halcomp, builder, useropts))
  instedt off
  return[PlasmaClass(halcomp, builder, useropts)]
  resulting in iteration over none object

ver. 1.1.5.7
- init dynamic tab now in try except to avoid python exception
  on user typos in ini file
- loading a tool using remap, leaded to an error if no file has been 
  loaded before the change, we do check for that now to avoid the error

ver. 1.1.5.6
- introduced three new hal-pin to signal program progress informations
  gmoccapy.program.length = S32, OUT (total number of program lines)
  gmoccapy.program.current-line =S32, OUT (current executed line)
  gmoccapy.program.progress = FLOAT, OUT (progress in %)

  This pin do not work very perfect when using subroutines or remap procedures

ver. 1.1.5.5
- if using remap, an error has been launched, if the user used the buttons of 
  the tool edit widget to change the tools (not possible to change to auto mode)
  I moved the resting procedure of self.tool_change to hal_status_intp_idle
  to solve the wrong behavior

ver. 1.1.5.4
- solved a bug showing screen2 at start up. Screen2 was initialized to early
  resulting in a runtime error

ver. 1.1.5.3
- solved a bug if the user have NO_FORCE_HOMING in his INI and did a homing
  of an axis, resulting in some widgets being unsensitized.
  Thanks to Marius for reporting that one
- after a tool touch off no G43 was committed even if that code was active 
  so I added that command to be executed
  Thanks to Rene to report that one
- some minor changes to lathe.ini, having HOME two times in the AXIS config

ver. 1.1.5.2
- solved a bug, on clear G92 offsets handling, switching the GUI to MDI Mode,
  due to a strange behavior of the offsetpage widget, not going back to the 
  previous mode.

ver. 1.1.5.1
- solved a bug related to the gmoccapy error pin. This pin has not been reseted
  if the user used the mouse or touch screen and erased the message by clicking
  the message button. It was only done right if the delete-message pin was used.
  I modified notification.py to emit a signal if a message has been deleted and 
  connected this signal to gmoccapy. 
- corrected also a small mistake in _show_errors, it was possible to get messages
  without text, added a default text. 

ver. 1.1.5
- added a option to hide the 4'th axis, this is useful if that axis is used
  to control a tool changer, as than the axis DRO and jog button are not needed.
  This has to be activated on the settings page, axis 4 is shown by default.
  This needed some code rework (moving code around)
- solved the problem of pin_value changes on start up / initializing, because I
  introduced a new intern variable self.initialized, leaving defs if not True
- introduced a adjustment widget on the settings page to allow the user to set
  the font size of the DRO, it will be reduced by 3/4 if 4 axis are used

ver. 1.1.4
- added again the gcode.lang file, it got lost, after changing gmoccapy to be
  stand alone
- the show screen2 button is now only sensitive if a file gmoccapy2.glade does
  exist in the config dir. 

ver. 1.1.3
- it was possible to push btn_set_selected on offset page to set a coordinate
  system with G92 selected, or being in edit offset mode, this is now avoided.

ver. 1.1.2
- after changing units according to G20 / G21 the scales to be applied to
  the jog wheel pin (jog_vel and max_vel has not been changed, resulting in
  very large jumps after changing from metric to imperial, i.e. one count
  should move the slider 100 increments in metric, but did that amount also 
  in imperial, instead only advancing 4 steps.
- all sliders and vel infos are now changing according to G20/G21 being active.
- There is still work to do on the offsetpage widget, IMHO it is buggy

ver. 1.1.1
- small bug in macro button handling, if a macro was not found, gmoccapy
  raised an exception, because wrong variable name.

ver. 1.1
- this is the "final" version, ready to be included in a release candidate
  I did not change anything related to the last push, but after 1.10.2, I 
  made a mistake with the release number, this push correct the error.

ver. 1.0.3.2
- includes version number also in settings page as label in the bottom button bar

ver. 1.0.3.1
- previous changes to NO_FORCE_HOMING resulted in automatic starting from
  line if a line has been selected in preview, I changed that so the line
  is just preselected, but not taken in care if run is pressed. The other way
  was to dangerous.

ver. 1.0.3
- solved some bugs in NO_FORCE_HOMING not handled the correct way
  with start button and mode changes after setup page
- get rid of hal_toggleaction_run and hal_action_stop, as the run widget
  caused one of the problems

ver. 1.0.2.1
- spindle feedback bar changes will not effect any more the
  speed label value. It was double information and at the same
  time confusing for users. The spindle feedback bar will 
  indicate the real spindle speed and the feed label will show 
  the programmed value.

ver. 1.0.2
- solved a bug in getting active gcodes, because I took also the first 
  element of linuxcnc.stat.gcodes, but that seems not to be a gcode, but 
  some kind of control number or something like that, so it causes wrong 
  code and changed gmoccapy behavior in an erroneous way
- In this bug finding I also needed to change the gladevcp widget combiDRO
  to get the correct results

ver. 1.0.10.2
- solved a small bug with _set_spindle in auto mode

ver. 1.0.10.1
- gremlin mouse button mode has not been initialized at start up

ver. 1.0.10
- changed the behavior of the spindle feedback bar and the speed labels
  we do not change the bar limits from negative to positive, we use
  from now on only abs values! That is the reason I did include a additional 
  abs in the postgui hal file
- corrected an error, not allowing to switch spindle on / off while program paused

ver. 1.0.9
- the ignore limits has not been called, due to a missing signal from the
  glade file, also the checkbox was hidden if machine off, so it could
  not be activated after hitting a limit switch.

ver. 1.0.8
- Thanks to Steffen Noack we got new gremlin function for the mouse button 
  behavior. Gmoccapy allows selecting the button mode from the settings page

ver. 1.0.7.1
- when a external ESTOP was active and the tbtn_estop has been clicked 
  it changed its color, but should not do so, solved
- when external estop was active, it was possible to click the on button
  and the GUI changed state making several widgets sensitive, that behavior
  was wrong, solved that.
- If you feed override has been changed and the machine went into estop, 
  a estop reset also reseted feed override to 100 % , now it will remain with 
  the value it had before estop.
- If a user activate logging actions, the logging was lost after shutting
  down the GUI, now the content of alarm_history will be written to a 
  file called gmoccapy.log in your config dir. The file will be overwritten 
  on each shutdown of gmoccapy with the new content.
- EXIT Button is now only sensitive, when machine is switched off, so it is
  not longer possible to accidentally shut down the machine.
- pressing estop from MDI mode with spindle on, resulted in an error, solved.

ver. 1.0.7
- Reworked the emergency button behavior as well as the 
  on/off button, as it was possible to set the GUI in an ESTOP_RESET
  state, even if an external SWITCH was in ESTOP State. The important
  bug has been found by Steffen, he also supplied the initial patch,
  witch has been adapted to my coding style ;-)
- Next changed the error handling, separated the error reporting from
  periodic to an own function, so we are able to launch also our own 
  errors over the same channel, and get error pin height and also 
  the sound will be played.
- Deleted some unneeded or double code.

ver. 1.0.6.3
- Bug turning on flood with M8 and logging actions on,
  found by Stephen, solved that one

ver. 1.0.6.2
- changed the standard setting of box_custom_? from
  expand = True to expand=False, so the panel will fit better
  found from verser building Z_compensation

ver. 1.0.6.1
- forgot to set error pin height if an error occurs ;-)

ver. 1.0.6
- Stefan found an error in getiniinfo, getting the PROGRAM_PREFIX from 
  INI file, if the entry does not exist. Solved!

ver. 1.0.6
- introduced new locations for EMBEDDED_TABS, it is possible to use 
  in addition to the previous ones now also:

  * box_cooling (will hide the cooling frame and introduce your glade file)
  * box_spindle (will hide the spindle frame and introduce your glade file)
  * box_vel_info  (will hide the velocity frames and introduce your glade file)
  * box_custom_1 (will introduce your glade file left of vel_frame)
  * box_custom_2 (will introduce your glade file left of cooling_frame)
  * box_custom_3 (will introduce your glade file left of spindle_frame)
  * box_custom_4 (will introduce your glade file right of spindle_frame)

  requested from verser

ver. 1.0.5 
- because of wrong steps in initializing the increment pins
  has not been made, I changed the init order and now they 
  are there again ;-)

ver. 1.0.4 - only plasma
- make the gmoccapy_plasma glade panels react to theme changes
  after the theme change, a restart of the GUI is necessary

ver. 1.0.4
- corrected the way of executing a program step by step 

ver. 1.0.3
- pressing the OFF button will bring you back to manual
  mode, because there is the "EXIT" button

ver. 1.0.2
- solved a spindle button issue and included a check so it
  is no possible to exceed the limits of the spindle with 
  override values. i.e. a spindle has a max of 6000 rpm and
  the user enters S 5500 M3 now he can increase the spindle 
  override, but it will be limited by 109 %, because otherwise
  he would ask the spindle to run faster than allowed.

ver. 1.0.1
- solved a bug, because I forgot to include some signals 
  in glade file, so no jogging with button was possible

ver. 1.0
- we reached the stable state! 
  gmoccapy get completely separated from gscreen, resulting 
  in a faster reaction and easier support and maintenance,
  as there is now less influence from the other gui.

ver. 0.9.9.9.16
- a manual entry in the preference file logo = True in
  combination with logofile = "absolute path to logofile"
  will hide the jog button, jog increments and ignore limits
  and display the logo instead.

ver. 0.9.9.9.15
- new hal pin gscreen.error as bit out, to show an error to the
  hardware, so a light can lit or even stop the machine. It will
  reseted with the pin gscreen.delete-message. This command will
  delete the first error and reset the gscreen.error pin to False 
  after the last error has been cleared. Messages or user infos
  will not affect this pin!  

ver. 0.9.9.9.14
- The usage of  "EMBED_TAB_LOCATION = box_coolant_and_spindle"
  will not hide the velocity widgets any more, plasma handles
  that one now over tool_info_panel 

ver. 0.9.9.9.13
- solved a bug switching on/off the spindle if also log_actions
  was active, 

ver. 0.9.9.9.12
- added two hal pin to reset feed and spindle override
  gscreen.reset-feed-override
  gscreen.reset-spindle-override 

ver. 0.9.9.9.11
- solved startup bug, window not starting in position and 
  dimensions as set in settings page
- set new limits to size adjustments

ver. 0.9.9.9.10
- added a refresh command to iconview, otherwise adding a file
  and reopening the view, would not refresh the view, so the 
  added file could not be selected

ver. 0.9.9.9.9
- I added three new hal pin. This pin do allow to reduce or 
  enlarge the soft limits, so a pin is able to protect your 
  rotary table from collision, because if you do not use it, 
  you just reduce your soft limits, or you got a tool changer
  in the working area, you do not want a collision during normal
  work, but you are forced to enter the tool change area to change 
  a tool, so during tool change you enlarge the soft limits.
  The pins are documented in the WIKI. You will get an error if you
  reduce the limits and you are outside the area!

ver. 0.9.9.9.8
- toggle button setup was not handled correct by hardware 
  momentary switches, fixed that

ver. 0.9.9.9.7
- add gcode highlight by clicking in the preview
  clicking a line in the preview will highlight the
  corresponding line in gcode listing

ver. 0.9.9.9.6
- solved show tool edit after program run
  after running a program and changing back to manual mode it was not 
  possible to enter again the tool edit tab, as we where taken to MDI mode
  this was mainly caused by the check for G43 being active.

ver. 0.9.9.9.5
- changed override behavior:
  feed override reduce the max velocity and the feed velocity, 
  but the jog vel slider will remain with it's value, 
  the override value will reduce the jog vel also!

ver. 0.9.9.9.4
- added a new pin to delete the last message

ver. 0.9.9.9.3
- scl_feed_override bug at start up,
  did not handle G0 Override correct, 
  thanks to Marius for reporting that bug 

ver. 0.9.9.9.2
- scl_feed_override did not take influence on G0 velocities
  now it will take influence G1 and G0 velocities

ver. 0.9.9.9.1
- there was a bug in tool touch off, discovered by Jim
  solved that

ver. 0.9.9.9
- gmoccapy is now able to do auto tool measurement after an manual tool change
- introduced a ini config to simulate that
- still to do: If user click on abort while the tool change message window is still open
  or he closes the window with the small X on the right upper corner, the hal pin will
  not be rested properly

ver. 0.9.9.8.2
- gmoccapy_plasma, changed pin names to follow the pin naming convention
- included THC Button state in persistence (plasma.var)

ver. 0.9.9.8.1
- self.data.jog_increments now is self.jog_increments
  changed the increments handling a little bit
  so there is no need any more for self.no_increments
- changed code from self.gscreen.halcomp to self.halcomp, because it is the same ;-)
- prepared to be able to get an gmoccapy hal component

ver. 0.9.9.8
- bug in jogging with buttons and SHIFT hold down, as that would
  result in a move at max velocity, not taking in care the max vel slider
- renamed self.data.ob to self.onboard_kb to make code clearer
- self.data.plot_view was a relict from gscreen, because gscreen needs to toggle 
  through the views, we can select them directly, so this data is gone now
- self.data.hide_cursor is now self.hide_cursor so this is different to gscreen, so 
  both GUI should not influence each other
- self.data.key_event_last changed to self.last_key_event (distinguish from gscreen)
- corrected some typo in release notes
- self.data.file replaced with self.stat.file, as it is not necessary to hold that on data
- self.data.estopped replaced with self.stat.task_state
- self.data.machine_on replaced with self.stat.task_state
- self.data.all_homed is now self.all_homed so I know that this value is not set from gscreen
- self.data.spindle_speed and self.data.spindle_direction replaced with self.stat statements
- self.data.flood and self.data.mist replaced with stat statements
- self.data.active_feed replaced with stat statements, resulting in auto units change also for
  the speed labels
- self.data.diameter_mode is now self.diameter_mode so its clear it come from gmoccapy
- gremlin does react now on auto_units behavior of Combi_DRO
- all sliders (scales) change according to active Gcode G20 / G21
- executing an MDI command will change the keyboard button to allow linuxcnc.abort()

ver. 0.9.9.7.6
- solved the bug wrong units on start up without the preference file
  I needed to replace gscreen.status with my my own status, because gscreen 
  does deliver wrong values!
- changed some more gscreen.data stuff to self.stat..., 
  because IMHO it is not necessary to use data to store something what is available
  through stat module
- replaced the preference file handling from gscreen to an own one, expecting that
  gscreen does not mess my files up, if no preference file will be given in the INI,
  we will use gmoccapy.pref stored in the config folder, so there could be different 
  configs with different settings 
- don't need gscreen.emc any more, all is done now directly with the linuxcnc python bindings
- I do not use any more the gscreen.ini, we use now the linuxcnc.ini version from the python module

ver. 0.9.9.7.5
- typo in initialize_preferences 
- deleted the statusbar widget
- no more option to use gscreen error handling
- no more option to use desktop notify
- the optional stops button worked opposite it should
- renamed some stuff from emc to linuxcnc or shortened the names
- onboard keyboard showing in edit mode corrected
- plasma.py changed order of getting widgets from builder, 
  to avoid errors at load time
- notification change line wrap mode to character, 
  so longer file names will not be cut

ver. 0.9.9.7.4
- the default tool change dialog now shows 
  the tool number and the tool description
- after deleting the preferences file you get an error starting the GUI, 
  because it tried to load a file " ", I deleted the SPACE to solve that

ver. 0.9.9.7.3
- plasma screen now hide also the vel_info_box
- minimal changes on the glade files
- modified the plasma.py file to support persistence variables
  the settings will be stored in plasma.var in your config dir
- I set the plasma.py file under GPL license

ver. 0.9.9.7.2
- introduced an better gcode highlight for sourceview

ver. 0.9.9.7.1
- replaced the hal_scale_jog_vel with a normal scale,
  as there is no need for a additional hal pin
- renamed hal pin 
  gscreen.hal_hbar_spindle_feedback to be gscreen.spindle_feedback_bar
  gscreen.hal_led_spindle_at_speed to be gscreen.spindle_at_speed_led
  This way all spindle pins are together in halshow 

ver. 0.9.9.7
- make gmoccapy react to external mode changes, i.e. start program with
  net start halui.mode.auto => halui.program.run <= hardware.button

ver. 0.9.9.6.3
- changed again the plasma layout, as Marius still want more widgets
- most hal labels are not needed any more, so I changed them to gtk.label

ver- 0.9.9.6.2
- added a lot of hal pin to gmoccapy_plasma, with the new 
  plasma.py file 
- reworked the plasma.glade file to fit Marius needs
- new order of configs, many files have been moved by Dewey Garret

ver. 0.9.9.6.1
- solved a bug in plasma.py, having a call without function

ver. 0.9.9.6
- made a new config folder to show gmoccapy as plasma screen
- included some minor changes to be able to place user glade panels 
  over the coolant and spindle frame, hiding the original widgets
  so plasma screen can easy be realized
  This will hide also the spindle speed label in gcode info frame.
- the tool info frame can also be hidden by a user glade file, because tool
  info is not needed for plasma.
- corrected an error in handling python calls in / for user glade screens,
  as example introduced plasma.glade plasma.hal and plasma.py demonstrating
  all possible communications

ver. 0.9.9.5
- added color chooser for homed and unhomed colors, as recommended
  by BigJohnT to help people suffering from protanopia (red/green weakness)
- corrected an error updating the DRO colors in lathe mode

ver. 0.9.9.4
- initializing some warnings at start up, corrected that
- deleted some unneeded print messages

ver. 0.9.9.3
- if the user tried to make a new file and there where no 
  RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE in the INI file, an exception has been thrown
  fixed that bug
- if the user tried to make a new file, after he made already one,
  an exception has been thrown, because the file was loaded already
  fixed that bug

ver. 0.9.9.2
- solved a bug, entering the edit mode from auto mode, caused by 
  a typo in a widget name

ver. 0.9.9.1
- solved a bug showing the gremlin DRO, caused by a typo in a widget name
- some buttons and widgets did not have tooltip text, added that ones
- corrected German translation
- corrected Spanish translation

ver. 0.9.9
- introduced a new DRO, showing all three positions (Abs, Rel, DTG) at ones
  user can toggle the DRO by clicking on them
- The new DRO also indicates the actual coordinate system
- The new DRO will change its units according to the active gcode (G20 / G21)
- There are still the three buttons, but they are hidden by default,
  this can be changed on the settings page, but when the buttons are visible,
  the user looses the auto units feature of the DRO
  Hope too get the permission from the users to delete that button as soon as possible
- made the documentation for IconViewFileSelection
- made the documentation for Combi_DRO
- This change saved some lines of code in gmoccapy.py and made the code
  a lot easier to understand
- updated German translation
- updated Spanish translation

ver. 0.9.8.4
- diameter dro does not show imperial units, even if machine units are imperial, fixed.
- tool info only with three digits in imperial mode, now 4 digits
- active feed and active vel label not in machine units, if in imperial mode, fixed
- cosmetic changes to gmoccapy_lathe.ini
- introduced a imperial lathe ini

ver 0.9.8.3
- BUG: forget to update the coordinate system after changing the error system,
  causing the ABS/REL button not showing the correct label, fixed
- BUG: inserted Jog Increment continuous instead of 0, so could cause an exception
  on translated GUI, fixed
- BUG: when changing the mode from outside, i.e. starting a program with an external button, 
  the GUI did not change the style to auto mode, so it was not consistent, fixed
- deleted unnecessary icon and introduced new icon for machine on off and for the
  mode button (Thanks to Dejan/probamo)

ver. 0.9.8.2
- make the design from spindle and coolant frames more beautiful
- added both to a hbox, so later this box may be replaced by user controls,
  i.e. plasma cutters

ver. 0.9.8.1
- introduced new Serbian translation

ver. 0.9.8
- introduced notification as gmoccapy error messaging system
- rebuild the settings page to make the message system settings available
- new default startup position
- changed DRO textcolor label to DRO background color label, because that is what you change
- jogging with keyboard will jog full speed if SHIFT is hold down

  like they should, but the icon didn't change from on/off, solved that changing _update_coolant
- when the tool was changed using M61Q, the screen has not been set back to manual mode properly,
  this was caused by asking if tool:, but as at the beginning toolnumber is zero, this decision was 
  taken wrong, after changing it to if tool or tool == 0: it does work
- running a macro changed the image and function of the keyboard button, 
  but the tool tip text didn't change, I fixed this.
- it was possible to reduce the max_vel of the machine less than the jog_velocity,
  so it was possible to jog faster than the max velocity you set with the corresponding slider

	* gscreen.spindle_override_counts
	* gscreen.feed_override_counts
	* gscreen.max_vel_counts
	* gscreen.jog_speed_counts
  Does anyone know, why the connection in postgui hal change the jog counts by one and 
  modify this way the scale from 100 to 101?

ver. 0.8.5
- included a button to toggle gremlin fullview
  but getting out of the fullscreen mode will hide the DRO not

- finished the hal connections also for the vertical buttons
  to test with simulated buttons, you have to uncomment the corresponding lines in INI and postgui.hal
  then two buttonlist will appear
- There was a problem executing the macros with the hardware button, 
  user where able to start a second macro while the first was still running, solved that
- Running macros can be aborted, the show_keyboard button will change it's image and 
  get an other function
 
ver. 0.7.07
- solved a problem switching main button list, wait on tool change has not
  been reseted properly
- now I hide the hbuttonbox of tooledit widget instead of every button,
  this saved 6 lines of code :-)

- finished the h_button hardware pin connection
- macros can be run by hardware button

  to test the features, just uncomment 3 lines in INI File DISPLAY section, see comments there
  and uncomment the connections made in gmoccapy_postgui.hal
  I need someone to test this with real hardware, as with gladevcp buttons there seems to be
  a problem with the mode settings, change a tool with M61 will not bring you back in manual mode 
  using the software keys, due to gladevcp in my opinion.

ver. 0.6.03
- optional blocks now working
- optional stops working too
- added missing button in MDI Keypad (I missed I ; J ; K )
- cooling and spindle buttons react to emc stat, so setting an M7 will
  toggle the corresponding button, so will an M3 or an M5
