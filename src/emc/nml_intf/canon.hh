/*
  This is the header file that all applications that use the
  canonical commands for three- to nine-axis machining should include.

  Three mutually orthogonal (in a right-handed system) X, Y, and Z axes
  are always present. In addition, there may be zero to three rotational
  axes: A (parallel to the X-axis), B (parallel to the Y-axis), and C
  (parallel to the Z-axis). Additionally there may be zero to three linear
  axes: U, V and W.

  In the functions that use rotational axes, the axis value is that of a
  wrapped linear axis, in degrees.

  It is assumed in these activities that the spindle tip is always at
  some location called the 'current location,' and the controller always
  knows where that is. It is also assumed that there is always a
  'selected plane' which must be the XY-plane, the YZ-plane, or the
  ZX-plane of the machine.

/* Machining Attributes */

extern void SET_FEED_RATE(double rate);

/*

SET_FEED_RATE sets the feed rate that will be used when the spindle is
told to move at the currently set feed rate. The rate is either:
1. the rate of motion of the tool tip in the workpiece coordinate system,
   which is used when the feed_reference mode is "CANON_WORKPIECE", or
2. the rate of motion of the tool tip in the XYZ axis system, ignoring
   motion of other axes, which is used when the feed_reference mode is
   "CANON_XYZ".

The units of the rate are:

1. If the feed_reference mode is CANON_WORKPIECE:
length units (inches or millimeters according to the setting of
CANON_UNITS) per minute along the programmed path as seen by the
workpiece.

2. If the feed_reference mode is CANON_XYZ:
A. For motion including one rotational axis only: degrees per minute.
B. For motion of two or three rotational axes with X, Y, Z, U, V, and W 
   axes not moving, the rate is applied as follows. Let dA, dB, and dC 
   be the angles in degrees through which the A, B, and C axes, 
   respectively, must move. Let D = sqrt(dA*dA + dB*dB + dC*dC). 
   Conceptually, D is a measure of total angular motion, using the usual 
   Euclidean metric. Let T be the amount of time required to move through 
   D degrees at the current feed rate in degrees per minute. The 
   rotational axes should be moved in coordinated linear motion so that 
   the elapsed time from the start to the end of the motion is T plus any 
   time required for acceleration or deceleration.
C. For motion of secondary linear axes (U, V, and/or W) with X, Y, and Z 
   axes not moving (with or without simultaneous rotational axis motion): 
   length units (inches or millimeters according to the setting of 
   CANON_UNITS) per minute in the UVW cartesian system.
D. For motion involving one or more of the XYZ axes (with or without
   simultaneous motion of other axes): length units (inches or
   millimeters according to the setting of CANON_UNITS) per minute
   along the programmed XYZ path.

*/

extern void SET_FEED_REFERENCE(CANON_FEED_REFERENCE reference);

/*

This sets the feed_reference mode to either CANON_WORKPIECE or
CANON_XYZ.

The CANON_WORKPIECE mode is more natural and general, since the rate
at which the tool passes through the material must be controlled for
safe and effective machining. For machines with more than the three
standard XYZ axes, however, computing the feed rate may be
time-consuming because the trajectories that result from motion in
four or more axes may be complex. Computation of path lengths when
only XYZ motion is considered is quite simple for the two standard
motion types (straight lines and helical arcs).

Some programming languages (rs274kt, in particular) use CANON_XYZ
mode. In these languages, the task of dealing with the rate at which
the tool tip passes through material is pushed back on the NC-program
generator, where the computation of path lengths is (almost always in
1995) an off-line activity where speed of calculation is not critical.

In CANON_WORKPIECE mode, some motions cannot be carried out as fast as
the programmed feed rate would require because axis motions tend to
cancel each other. For example, an arc in the YZ-plane can exactly
cancel a rotation around the A-axis, so that the location of the tool
tip with respect to the workpiece does not change at all during the
motion; in this case, the motion should take no time, which is
impossible at any finite rate of axis motion. In such cases, the axes
should be moved as fast as possible consistent with accurate
machining.

It would be possible to omit the SET_FEED_REFERENCE command from the
canonical commands and operate always in one mode or the other,
letting the interpreter issue SET_FEED_RATE commands, if necessary to
compensate if the NC language being interpreted used the other mode.

This would create two disadvantages when the feed_reference mode
assumed by the canonical commands differed from that assumed by the NC
language being interpreted:

1. The output code could have a lot of SET_FEED_RATE commands not
found in the input code; this is a relatively minor consideration.

2. If the interpreter reads a program in language which uses the
CANON_XYZ mode and writes canonical commands in the CANON_WORKPIECE
mode, both the interpreter and the executor of the output canonical
commands would have to perform a lot of complex calculations. With the
SET_FEED_REFERENCE command available, both do only simple calculations
for the same motions.

/* Move in a helical arc from the current location at the existing feed
rate. The axis of the helix is parallel to the x, y, or z axis,
according to which one is perpendicular to the selected plane. The
helical arc may degenerate to a circular arc if there is no motion
parallel to the axis of the helix.

1. If the selected plane is the xy-plane:
A. first_end is the x-coordinate of the end of the arc.
B. second_end is the y-coordinate of the end of the arc.
C. first_axis is the x-coordinate of the axis (center) of the arc.
D. second_axis is the y-coordinate of the axis.
E. axis_end_point is the z-coordinate of the end of the arc.

2. If the selected plane is the yz-plane:
A. first_end is the y-coordinate of the end of the arc.
B. second_end is the z-coordinate of the end of the arc.
C. first_axis is the y-coordinate of the axis (center) of the arc.
D. second_axis is the z-coordinate of the axis.
E. axis_end_point is the x-coordinate of the end of the arc.

3. If the selected plane is the zx-plane:
A. first_end is the z-coordinate of the end of the arc.
B. second_end is the x-coordinate of the end of the arc.
C. first_axis is the z-coordinate of the axis (center) of the arc.
D. second_axis is the x-coordinate of the axis.
E. axis_end_point is the y-coordinate of the end of the arc.

If rotation is positive, the arc is traversed counterclockwise as
viewed from the positive end of the coordinate axis perpendicular to
the currently selected plane. If rotation is negative, the arc is
traversed clockwise. If rotation is 0, first_end and second_end must
be the same as the corresponding coordinates of the current point and
no arc is made (but there may be translation parallel to the axis
perpendicular to the selected plane and motion along the rotational axes).
If rotation is 1, more than 0 but not more than 360 degrees of arc
should be made. In general, if rotation is n, the amount of rotation
in the arc should be more than ([n-1] x 360) but not more than (n x
360).

The radius of the helix is determined by the distance from the current
location to the axis of helix or by the distance from the end location
to the axis of the helix. It is recommended that the executing system
verify that the two radii are the same (within some tolerance) at the
beginning of executing this function.

While the XYZ motion is going on, move the rotational axes so that
they have always covered the same proportion of their total motion as
a point moving along the arc has of its total motion.

/* It is assumed that each cutting tool in the machine is assigned to a
slot (intended to correspond to a slot number in a tool carousel).
This command results in the tool currently in the spindle (if any)
being returned to its slot, and the tool from the slot designated by
slot_number (if any) being inserted in the spindle.

If there is no tool in the slot designated by the slot argument, there
will be no tool in the spindle after this command is executed and no
error condition will result in the controller. Similarly, if there is
no tool in the spindle when this command is given, no tool will be
returned to the carousel and no error condition will result in the
controller, whether or not a tool was previously selected in the
program.

It is expected that when the machine tool controller is initialized,
the designated slot for a tool already in the spindle will be
established. This may be done in any manner deemed fit, including
(for, example) recording that information in a persistent, crash-proof
location so it is always available from the last time the machine was
run, or having the operator enter it. It is expected that the machine
tool controller will remember that information as long as it is
not re-initialized; in particular, it will be remembered between
programs.

For the purposes of this command, the tool includes the tool holder.

For machines which can carry out a select_tool command separately from
a change_tool command, the select_tool command must have been given
before the change_tool command, and the value of slot must be the slot
number of the selected tool. */

to allow emc2 to safely restart knowing what tool is in the spindle.
Using CHANGE_TOOL_NUMBER one can tell emc2 (without any physical action)
to set the mapping of the currently loaded tool to a certain number */
