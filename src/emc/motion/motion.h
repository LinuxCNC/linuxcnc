Misc ramblings:

The terms axis and joint are used inconsistently throughout EMC.
For all new code, the usages are as follows:

    axis - one of the nine degrees of freedom, x, y, z, a, b, c, u, v, w
	these refer to axes in Cartesian space, which may or
	may not match up with joints (see below). On Cartesian
	machines they do match up, but for hexapods, robots, and
	other non-Cartesian machines they don't.
    joint - one of the physical degrees of freedom of the machine
	these might be linear (leadscrews) or rotary (rotary
	tables, robot arm joints).  There can be any number of
	joints.  The kinematics code is responsible for translating
	from axis space to joint space and back.

There are three main kinds of data needed by the motion controller

1) data shared with higher level stuff - commands, status, etc.
2) data that is local to the motion controller
3) data shared with lower level stuff - hal pins

In addition, some internal data (2) should be shared for trouble
shooting purposes, even though it is "internal" to the motion
controller.  Depending on the type of data, it can either be
treated as type (1), and made available to the higher level
code, or it can be treated as type (3), and made available to
the hal, so that halscope can monitor it.

This file should ONLY contain structures and declarations for
type (1) items - those that are shared with higher level code.

Type (2) items should be declared in mot_priv.h, along
with type (3) items.

In the interest of retaining my sanity, I'm not gonna attempt
to move everything to its proper location yet....

However, all new items will be defined in the proper place,
and some existing items may be moved from one struct definition
to another.

/* the following line can be used to control where some of the
   "internal" motion controller data is stored.  By default,
   it is stored in staticlly allocated kernel memory.  However,
   if STRUCTS_IN_SHMEM is defined, it will be stored in the
   emcmotStruct shared memory area, for debugging purposes.

/*! \todo FIXME - the terms "teleop", "coord", and "free" are poorly
   documented.  This is my feeble attempt to understand exactly
   what they mean.

   According to Fred, teleop is never used with machine tools,
   although that may not be true for machines with non-trivial
   kinematics.

   "coord", or coordinated mode, means that all the joints are
   synchronized, and move together as commanded by the higher
   level code.  It is the normal mode when machining.  In
   coordinated mode, commands are assumed to be in the cartesean
   reference frame, and if the machine is non-cartesean, the
   commands are translated by the kinematics to drive each
   joint in joint space as needed.

   "free" mode means commands are interpreted in joint space.
   It is used for jogging individual joints, although
   it does not preclude multiple joints moving at once (I think).
   Homing is also done in free mode, in fact machines with
   non-trivial kinematics must be homed before they can go
   into either coord or teleop mode.

   'teleop' is what you probably want if you are 'jogging'
   a hexapod.  The jog commands as implemented by the motion
   controller are joint jogs, which work in free mode.  But
   if you want to jog a hexapod or similar machine along
   one particular cartesean axis, you need to operate more
   than one joint.  That's what 'teleop' is for.
