/*! read_a

Returned Value: int
   If read_real_value returns an error code, this returns that code.
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns INTERP_OK.
   1. The first character read is not a:
      NCE_BUG_FUNCTION_SHOULD_NOT_HAVE_BEEN_CALLED
   2. An a_coordinate has already been inserted in the block:
      NCE_MULTIPLE_A_WORDS_ON_ONE_LINE.
   3. A values are not allowed: NCE_CANNOT_USE_A_WORD.

Side effects:
   counter is reset.
   The a_flag in the block is turned on.
   An a_number is inserted in the block.

Called by: read_one_item

When this function is called, counter is pointing at an item on the
line that starts with the character 'a', indicating an a_coordinate
setting. The function reads characters which tell how to set the
coordinate, up to the start of the next item or the end of the line.
The counter is then set to point to the character following.

The value may be a real number or something that evaluates to a
real number, so read_real_value is used to read it. Parameters
may be involved.

If the AA compiler flag is defined, the a_flag in the block is turned
on and the a_number in the block is set to the value read. If the
AA flag is not defined, (i) if the AXIS_ERROR flag is defined, that means
A values are not allowed, and an error value is returned, (ii) if the
AXIS_ERROR flag is not defined, nothing is done.

/*! read_atan

Returned Value: int
   If read_real_expression returns an error code, this returns that code.
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns INTERP_OK.
   1. The first character to read is not a slash:
      NCE_SLASH_MISSING_AFTER_FIRST_ATAN_ARGUMENT
   2. The second character to read is not a left bracket:

Side effects:
   The computed value is put into what double_ptr points at.
   The counter is reset to point to the first character after the
   characters which make up the value.

Called by:
   read_unary

When this function is called, the characters "atan" and the first
argument have already been read, and the value of the first argument
is stored in double_ptr.  This function attempts to read a slash and
the second argument to the atan function, starting at the index given
by the counter and then to compute the value of the atan operation
applied to the two arguments.  The computed value is inserted into
what double_ptr points at.

The computed value is in the range from -180 degrees to +180 degrees.
The range is not specified in the RS274/NGC manual [NCMS, page 51],
although using degrees (not radians) is specified.

have prevented the system from getting this far, so that this function
can assume a close parenthesis will be found when an open parenthesis
has been found, and that comments are not nested.

   A g code is inserted as the value of the appropriate mode in the

Called by: read_one_item

When this function is called, counter is pointing at an item on the
line that starts with the character 'g', indicating a g_code.  The
function reads characters which tell how to set the g_code.

The RS274/NGC manual [NCMS, page 51] allows g_codes to be represented
by expressions and provide [NCMS, 71 - 73] that a g_code must evaluate
to to a number of the form XX.X (59.1, for example). The manual does not
say how close an expression must come to one of the allowed values for
it to be legitimate. Is 59.099999 allowed to mean 59.1, for example?
In the interpreter, we adopt the convention that the evaluated number
for the g_code must be within 0.0001 of a value of the form XX.X

To simplify the handling of g_codes, we convert them to integers by
multiplying by 10 and rounding down or up if within 0.001 of an
integer. Other functions that deal with g_codes handle them
symbolically, however. The symbols are defined in rs274NGC.hh
where G_1 is 10, G_83 is 830, etc.

This allows any number of g_codes on one line, provided that no two
are in the same modal group.

This allows G80 on the same line as one other g_code with the same
mode. If this happens, the G80 is simply ignored.

Returned Value: int

   Otherwise, it returns INTERP_OK.
   1. the first character read is not a known character for starting a
   word: NCE_BAD_CHARACTER_USED

Side effects:
   This function reads one item from a line of RS274/NGC code and inserts
   the information in a block. System parameters may be reset.

Called by: read_items.

When this function is called, the counter is set so that the position
being considered is the first position of a word. The character at
that position must be one known to the system.  In this version those
characters are: a,b,c,d,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,p,q,r,s,t,x,y,z,(,#,;.
However, read_items calls read_n_number directly if the first word
begins with n, so no read function is included in the "_readers" array
for the letter n. Thus, if an n word is encountered in the middle of
a line, this function reports NCE_BAD_CHARACTER_USED.

The function looks for a letter or special character and matches it to
a pointer to a function in _readers[] - The position of the function
pointers in the array match their ASCII number.
Once the character has been matched, the function calls a selected function
according to what the letter or character is.  The selected function will
be responsible to consider all the characters that comprise the remainder
of the item, and reset the pointer so that it points to the next character
after the end of the item (which may be the end of the line or the first
character of another item).

After an item is read, the counter is set at the index of the
next unread character. The item data is stored in the block.

It is expected that the format of a comment will have been checked;
this is being done by close_and_downcase. Bad format comments will
have prevented the system from getting this far, so that this function
can assume a close parenthesis will be found when an open parenthesis
has been found, and that comments are not nested.

/* read_o

Returned Value: int
   If read_real_value returns an error code, this returns that code.
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns RS274NGC_OK.
   1. The first character read is not o:
      NCE_BUG_FUNCTION_SHOULD_NOT_HAVE_BEEN_CALLED

Side effects:
   counter is reset to point to the first character following the p value.
   The p value setting is inserted in block.

Called by: read_one_item

When this function is called, counter is pointing at an item on the
line that starts with the character 'o', indicating a o value
setting. The function reads characters which tell how to set the o
value, up to the start of the next item or the end of the line. This
information is inserted in the block.

O codes are used for:
1.  sub
2.  endsub
3.  call
4.  do
5.  while
6.  if
7.  elseif
8.  else
9.  endif
10. break
11. continue
12. endwhile
13. return

Labels (o-words) are of local scope except for sub, endsub, and call which
are of global scope.

Named o-words and scoping of o-words are implemented now.
Numeric o-words get converted to strings. Global o-words are stored as
just the string. Local o-words are stored as the name (o-word) of the
sub containing the o-word, followed by a '#', followed by the local o-word.
If the local o-word is not contained within a sub, then the sub name is null
and the o-word just begins with a '#'.

It has been a pain to do this because o-words are used as integers all over
the place.
!!!KL the code could use some cleanup.

Called by:  read_real_value

This attempts to read the value of a parameter out of the line,
starting at the index given by the counter.

According to the RS274/NGC manual [NCMS, p. 62], the characters following
# may be any "parameter expression". Thus, the following are legal
and mean the same thing (the value of the parameter whose number is
stored in parameter 2):
  ##2
  #[#2]

Parameter setting is done in parallel, not sequentially. For example
if #1 is 5 before the line "#1=10 #2=#1" is read, then after the line
is is executed, #1 is 10 and #2 is 5. If parameter setting were done
sequentially, the value of #2 would be 10 after the line was executed.

ADDED by K. Lerman
Named parameters are now supported.
#[abcd] is a parameter with name "abcd"
#[#2] is NOT a named parameter.
When a [ is seen after a #, if the next char is not a #, it is a named
parameter.

Side effects:
   counter is reset to the character following the end of the parameter
   setting. The parameter whose index follows "#" is set to the
   real value following "=".

Called by: read_one_item

When this function is called, counter is pointing at an item on the
line that starts with the character '#', indicating a parameter
setting when found by read_one_item.  The function reads characters
which tell how to set the parameter.

Any number of parameters may be set on a line. If parameters set early
on the line are used in expressions farther down the line, the
parameters have their old values, not their new values. This is
usually called setting parameters in parallel.

Parameter setting is not clearly described in [NCMS, pp. 51 - 62]: it is
not clear if more than one parameter setting per line is allowed (any
number is OK in this implementation). The characters immediately following
the "#" must constitute a "parameter expression", but it is not clear
what that is. Here we allow any expression as long as it evaluates to
an integer.

Parameters are handled in the interpreter by having a parameter table
and a parameter buffer as part of the machine settings. The parameter
table is passed to the reading functions which need it. The parameter
buffer is used directly by functions that need it. Reading functions
may set parameter values in the parameter buffer. Reading functions
may obtain parameter values; these come from parameter table.

The parameter buffer has three parts: (i) a counter for how many
parameters have been set while reading the current line (ii) an array
of the indexes of parameters that have been set while reading the
current line, and (iii) an array of the values for the parameters that
have been set while reading the current line; the nth value
corresponds to the nth index. Any given index will appear once in the
index number array for each time the parameter with that index is set
on a line. There is no point in setting the same parameter more than
one on a line because only the last setting of that parameter will
take effect.

The syntax recognized by this this function is # followed by an
integer expression (explicit integer or expression evaluating to an
integer) followed by = followed by a real value (number or
expression).

Note that # also starts a bunch of characters which represent a parameter
to be evaluated. That situation is handled by read_parameter.

Segmenting Expressions -

The RS274/NGC manual, section 3.5.1.1 [NCMS, page 50], provides for
using square brackets to segment expressions.

Binary Operations -

The RS274/NGC manual, section 3.5.1.1, discusses expression evaluation.
The manual provides for eight binary operations: the four basic
mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division), three logical operations (non-exclusive ||, exclusive ||,
and AND2) and the modulus operation. The manual does not explicitly call
these "binary" operations, but implicitly recognizes that they are
binary. We have added the "power" operation of raising the number
on the left of the operation to the power on the right; this is
needed for many basic machining calculations.

There are two groups of binary operations given in the manual. If
operations are strung together as shown in Example 1, operations in
the first group are to be performed before operations in the second
group. If an expression contains more than one operation from the same
group (such as * and / in Example 1), the operation on the left is
performed first. The first group is: multiplication (*), division (/),
and modulus (MOD). The second group is: addition(+), subtraction (-),
logical non-exclusive || (||), logical exclusive || (XOR), and logical
&& (AND2). We have added a third group with higher precedence than
the first group. The third group contains only the power (**)
operation.

The logical operations and modulus are apparently to be performed on
any real numbers, not just on integers or on some other data type.

Unary Operations -

The RS274/NGC manual, section 3.5.1.2, provides for fifteen unary
mathematical operations. Two of these, BIN and BCD, are apparently for
converting between decimal and hexadecimal number representation,
although the text is not clear. These have not been implemented, since
we are not using any hexadecimal numbers. The other thirteen unary
operations have been implemented: absolute_value, arc_cosine, arc_sine,
arc_tangent, cosine, e_raised_to, fix_down, fix_up, natural_log_of,
round, sine, square_root, tangent.

The manual section 3.5.1.2 [NCMS, page 51] requires the argument to
all unary operations (except atan) to be in square brackets.  Thus,
for example "sin[90]" is allowed in the interpreter, but "sin 90" is
not. The atan operation must be in the format "atan[..]/[..]".

Production Rule Definitions in Terms of Tokens -

The following is a production rule definition of what this RS274NGC
interpreter recognizes as valid combinations of symbols which form a
recognized real_value (the top of this production hierarchy).

The notion of "integer_value" is used in the interpreter. Below it is
defined as a synonym for real_value, but in fact a constraint is added
which cannot be readily written in a production language.  An
integer_value is a real_value which is very close to an integer.
Integer_values are needed for array and table indices and (when
divided by 10) for the values of M codes and G codes. All numbers
(including integers) are read as real numbers and stored as doubles.
If an integer_value is required in some situation, a test for being
close to an integer is applied to the number after it is read.

When this function is called, the counter should be set at a left
bracket. The function reads up to and including the right bracket
which closes the expression.

The basic form of an expression is: [v1 bop v2 bop ... vn], where the
vi are real_values and the bops are binary operations. The vi may be
numbers, parameters, expressions, or unary functions. Because some
bops are to be evaluated before others, for understanding the order of
evaluation, it is useful to rewrite the general form collecting any
subsequences of bops of the same precedence. For example, suppose the
expression is: [9+8*7/6+5-4*3**2+1]. It may be rewritten as:
[9+[8*7/6]+5-[4*[3**2]]+1] to show how it should be evaluated.

The manual provides that operations of the same precedence should be
processed left to right.

The first version of this function is commented out. It is suitable
for when there are only two precendence levels. It is an improvement
over the version used in interpreters before 2000, but not as general
as the second version given here.

The first version of this function reads the first value and the first
operation in the expression. Then it calls either read_rest_bop1 or
read_rest_bop2 according to whether the first operation is a bop1 or a
bop2.  Read_rest_bop1 resets the next_operation to either a right
bracket or a bop2. If it is reset to a bop2, read_rest_bop2 is called
when read_rest_bop1 returns.

/*! read_real_expression

The following version is stack-based and fully general. It is the
classical stack-based version with left-to-right evaluation of
operations of the same precedence. Separate stacks are used for
operations and values, and the stacks are made with arrays
rather than lists, but those are implementation details. Pushing
and popping are implemented by increasing or decreasing the
stack index.

Additional levels of precedence may be defined easily by changing the
precedence function. The size of MAX_STACK should always be at least
as large as the number of precedence levels used. We are currently
using four precedence levels (for right-bracket, plus-like operations,
times-like operations, and power).

N.B.: We are now using six levels (right-bracket, logical operations,
relational operations, plus-like operations, times-like operations, and
power).

The first character may be a digit, "+", "-", or "."
Every following character must be a digit or "." up to anything
that is not a digit or "." (a second "." terminates reading).

This function is not called if the first character is NULL, so it is
not necessary to check that.

The temporary insertion of a NULL character on the line is to avoid
making a format string like "%3lf" which the LynxOS compiler cannot
handle.

Side effects: See below

Called by:  Interp::read

This reads a line of RS274 code from a command string or a file into
the line array. If the command string is not null, the file is ignored.

If the end of file is reached, an error is returned as described
above. The end of the file should not be reached because (a) if the
file started with a percent line, it must end with a percent line, and
no more reading of the file should occur after that, and (b) if the
file did not start with a percent line, it must have a program ending
command (M2 or M30) in it, and no more reading of the file should
occur after that.

All blank space at the end of a line read from a file is removed and
replaced here with NULL characters.

This then calls close_and_downcase to downcase and remove tabs and
spaces from everything on the line that is not part of a comment. Any
comment is left as is.

The length is set to zero if any of the following occur:
1. The line now starts with a slash, but the second character is NULL.
2. The first character is NULL.
Otherwise, length is set to the length of the line.

An input line is blank if the first character is NULL or it consists
entirely of tabs and spaces and, possibly, a newline before the first
NULL.

Block delete is discussed in [NCMS, page 3] but the discussion makes
no sense. Block delete is handled by having this function return
INTERP_EXECUTE_FINISH if the first character of the
close_and_downcased line is a slash. When the caller sees this,
the caller is expected not to call Interp::execute if the switch
is on, but rather call Interp::read again to overwrite and ignore
what is read here.

The value of the length argument is set to the number of characters on
the reduced line.
