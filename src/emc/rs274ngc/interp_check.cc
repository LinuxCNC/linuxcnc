/*! check_g_codes

Returned Value: int
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error shown.
   Otherwise, it returns INTERP_OK.
   1. NCE_DWELL_TIME_MISSING_WITH_G4
   2. NCE_MUST_USE_G0_OR_G1_WITH_G53

   7. NCE_BUG_BAD_G_CODE_MODAL_GROUP_0

Side effects: none

Called by: check_items

This runs checks on g_codes from a block of RS274/NGC instructions.
Currently, all checks are on g_codes in modal group 0.

The read_g function checks for errors which would foul up the reading.
The enhance_block function checks for logical errors in the use of
axis values by G-codes in modal groups 0 and 1.
This function checks for additional logical errors in g_codes.

[Fanuc, page 45, note 4] says there is no maximum for how many g_codes
may be put on the same line, [NCMS] says nothing one way or the other,
so the test for that is not used.

We are suspending any implicit motion g_code when a g_code from our
group 0 is used.  The implicit motion g_code takes effect again
automatically after the line on which the group 0 g_code occurs.  It
is not clear what the intent of [Fanuc] is in this regard. The
alternative is to require that any implicit motion be explicitly
cancelled.

Not all checks on g_codes are included here. Those checks that are
sensitive to whether other g_codes on the same line have been executed
yet are made by the functions called by convert_g.

Our reference sources differ regarding what codes may be used for
dwell time.  [Fanuc, page 58] says use "p" or "x". [NCMS, page 23] says
use "p", "x", or "u". We are allowing "p" only, since it is consistent
with both sources and "x" would be confusing. However, "p" is also used
with G10, where it must be an integer, so reading "p" values is a bit
more trouble than would be nice.
