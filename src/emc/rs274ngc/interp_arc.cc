   1. The two calculable values of the radius differ by more than
      tolerance: NCE_RADIUS_TO_END_OF_ARC_DIFFERS_FROM_RADIUS_TO_START

Called by: convert_arc_comp1

This finds the center coordinates and number of full or partial turns
counterclockwise of a helical or circular arc in ijk-format in the XY
plane. The center is computed easily from the current point and center
offsets, which are given. It is checked that the end point lies one
tool radius from the arc.

/*! arc_data_comp_r

Returned Value: int
   If any of the following errors occur, this returns the error code shown.
   Otherwise, it returns INTERP_OK.
   1. The arc radius is too small to reach the end point:
      NCE_RADIUS_TOO_SMALL_TO_REACH_END_POINT
   2. The arc radius is not greater than the tool_radius, but should be:
      NCE_TOOL_RADIUS_NOT_LESS_THAN_ARC_RADIUS_WITH_COMP
   3. An imaginary value for offset would be found, which should never
      happen if the theory is correct: NCE_BUG_IN_TOOL_RADIUS_COMP

Side effects:
   This finds and sets the values of center_x, center_y, and turn.

Called by: convert_arc_comp1

This finds the center coordinates and number of full or partial turns
counterclockwise of a helical or circular arc (call it arc1) in
r-format in the XY plane.  Arc2 is constructed so that it is tangent
to a circle whose radius is tool_radius and whose center is at the
point (current_x, current_y) and passes through the point (end_x,
end_y). Arc1 has the same center as arc2. The radius of arc1 is one
tool radius larger or smaller than the radius of arc2.

If the value of the big_radius argument is negative, that means [NCMS,
page 21] that an arc larger than a semicircle is to be made.
Otherwise, an arc of a semicircle or less is made.

The algorithm implemented here is to construct a line L from the
current point to the end point, and a perpendicular to it from the
center of the arc which intersects L at point P. Since the distance
from the end point to the center and the distance from the current
point to the center are known, two equations for the length of the
perpendicular can be written. The right sides of the equations can be
set equal to one another and the resulting equation solved for the
length of the line from the current point to P. Then the location of
P, the length of the perpendicular, the angle of the perpendicular,
and the location of the center, can be found in turn.

This needs to be better documented, with figures. There are eight
possible arcs, since there are three binary possibilities: (1) tool
inside or outside arc, (2) clockwise or counterclockwise (3) two
positions for each arc (of the given radius) tangent to the tool
outline and through the end point. All eight are calculated below,
since theta, radius2, and turn may each have two values.

To see two positions for each arc, imagine the arc is a hoop, the
tool is a cylindrical pin, and the arc may rotate around the end point.
The rotation covers all possible positions of the arc. It is easy to
see the hoop is constrained by the pin at two different angles, whether
the pin is inside or outside the hoop.
