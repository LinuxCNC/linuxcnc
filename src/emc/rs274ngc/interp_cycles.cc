For the XY plane, this implements the following RS274/NGC cycle, which
is usually drilling:
1. Move the z-axis only at the current feed rate to the specified bottom_z.
2. Retract the z-axis at traverse rate to clear_z.

For the XY plane, this implements the following RS274/NGC cycle, which
is usually back boring.  The situation is that you have a through hole
and you want to counterbore the bottom of hole. To do this you put an
L-shaped tool in the spindle with a cutting surface on the UPPER side
of its base. You stick it carefully through the hole when it is not
spinning and is oriented so it fits through the hole, then you move it
so the stem of the L is on the axis of the hole, start the spindle,
and feed the tool upward to make the counterbore. Then you get the
tool out of the hole.

1. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the point
   with x-value offset_x and y-value offset_y.
2. Stop the spindle in a specific orientation.
3. Move the z-axis only at traverse rate downward to the bottom_z.
4. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the x,y location.
5. Start the spindle in the direction it was going before.
6. Move the z-axis only at the given feed rate upward to the middle_z.
7. Move the z-axis only at the given feed rate back down to bottom_z.
8. Stop the spindle in the same orientation as before.
9. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the point
   with x-value offset_x and y-value offset_y.
10. Move the z-axis only at traverse rate to the clear z value.
11. Move at traverse rate parallel to the XY-plane to the specified x,y
    location.
12. Restart the spindle in the direction it was going before.

CYCLE_MACRO has positioned the tool at (x, y, r, a, b, c) before this starts.

It might be useful to add a check that clear_z > middle_z > bottom_z.
Without the check, however, this can be used to counterbore a hole in
material that can only be accessed through a hole in material above it.

For the XZ and YZ planes, this makes analogous motions.

Called by: convert_cycle

The function does not require that any of x,y,z, or r be specified in
the block, except that if the last motion mode command executed was
not the same as this one, the r-value and z-value must be specified.

This function is handling the repeat feature of RS274/NGC, wherein
the L word represents the number of repeats [NCMS, page 99]. We are
not allowing L=0, contrary to the manual. We are allowing L > 1
in absolute distance mode to mean "do the same thing in the same
place several times", as provided in the manual, although this seems
abnormal.

In incremental distance mode, x, y, and r values are treated as
increments to the current position and z as an increment from r.  In
absolute distance mode, x, y, r, and z are absolute. In g87, i and j
will always be increments, regardless of the distance mode setting, as
implied in [NCMS, page 98], but k (z-value of top of counterbore) will
be an absolute z-value in absolute distance mode, and an increment
(from bottom z) in incremental distance mode.

If the r position of a cycle is above the current_z position, this
retracts the z-axis to the r position before moving parallel to the
XY plane.

In the code for this function, there is a nearly identical "for" loop
in every case of the switch. The loop is the done with a compiler
macro, "CYCLE_MACRO" so that the code is easy to read, automatically
kept identical from case to case and, and much shorter than it would
be without the macro. The loop could be put outside the switch, but
then the switch would run every time around the loop, not just once,
as it does here. The loop could also be placed in the called
functions, but then it would not be clear that all the loops are the
same, and it would be hard to keep them the same when the code is
modified.  The macro would be very awkward as a regular function
because it would have to be passed all of the arguments used by any of
the specific cycles, and, if another switch in the function is to be
avoided, it would have to passed a function pointer, but the different
cycle functions have different arguments so the type of the pointer
could not be declared unless the cycle functions were re-written to
take the same arguments (in which case most of them would have several
unused arguments).

The motions within the CYCLE_MACRO (but outside a specific cycle) are
a straight traverse parallel to the selected plane to the given
position in the plane and a straight traverse of the third axis only
(if needed) to the r position.

The CYCLE_MACRO is defined here but is also used in convert_cycle_yz
and convert_cycle_zx. The variables aa, bb, and cc are used in
CYCLE_MACRO and in the other two functions just mentioned. Those
variables represent the first axis of the selected plane, the second
axis of the selected plane, and third axis which is perpendicular to
the selected plane.  In this function aa represents x, bb represents
y, and cc represents z. This usage makes it possible to have only one
version of each of the cycle functions.  The cycle_traverse and
cycle_feed functions help accomplish this.

The height of the retract move at the end of each repeat of a cycle is
determined by the setting of the retract_mode: either to the r
position (if the retract_mode is R_PLANE) or to the original
z-position (if that is above the r position and the retract_mode is
not R_PLANE). This is a slight departure from [NCMS, page 98], which
does not require checking that the original z-position is above r.

The rotary axes may not move during a canned cycle.

   1. The x-value is not given the first time this code is called after
      some other motion mode has been in effect:

   2. The r clearance plane is below the bottom_x:

   3. the distance mode is neither absolute or incremental:
      NCE_BUG_DISTANCE_MODE_NOT_G90_OR_G91
   4. G82, G86, G88, or G89 is called when it is not already in effect,

   6. G87 is called when it is not already in effect,

      NCE_J_WORD_MISSING_WITH_G87
      NCE_K_WORD_MISSING_WITH_G87
   7. the G code is not between G_81 and G_89.
      NCE_BUG_FUNCTION_SHOULD_NOT_HAVE_BEEN_CALLED

Side effects:
   A number of moves are made to execute a canned cycle.

Called by: convert_cycle

See the documentation of convert_cycle_xy. This function is entirely
similar. In this function aa represents y, bb represents z, and cc
represents x.

The CYCLE_MACRO is defined just before the convert_cycle_xy function.

Tool length offsets work only when the tool axis is parallel to the
Z-axis, so if this function is used, tool length offsets should be
turned off, and the NC code written to take tool length into account.

Side effects:
   A number of moves are made to execute a canned cycle.

Called by: convert_cycle

See the documentation of convert_cycle_xy. This function is entirely
similar. In this function aa represents z, bb represents x, and cc
represents y.

The CYCLE_MACRO is defined just before the convert_cycle_xy function.

Tool length offsets work only when the tool axis is parallel to the
Z-axis, so if this function is used, tool length offsets should be
turned off, and the NC code written to take tool length into account.

It is a little distracting that this function uses zx in some places
and xz in others; uniform use of zx would be nice, since that is the
order for a right-handed coordinate system. Also with that usage,
permutation of the symbols x, y, and z would allow for automatically
converting the convert_cycle_xy function (or convert_cycle_yz) into
the convert_cycle_xz function. However, the canonical interface uses
CANON_PLANE_XZ.
