			Introduction

Most of this style guide has been copied wholesale from the linux kernel
documents - See linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for the full text.
The C++ recommendations have been drawn from various sources such as the
GTK headers, "C++ The Complete Reference" by Schildt, and IRC discussions.


 			Indentation

Rationale: The whole idea behind indentation is to clearly define where
a block of control starts and ends.  Especially when you've been looking
at your screen for 20 straight hours, you'll find it a lot easier to see
how the indentation works if you have large indentations. 

Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes
the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a
80-character terminal screen. Whilst the GNU style of 2-character 
indentations reduces the clarity. For EMC2, a compromise of 4-character
indentation has been chosen. This still spreads the code out and causes
lines to wrap round leading to difficulties in reading the sources. The 
answer to that is that if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're
screwed anyway, and should fix your program. 


			Placing Braces

The other issue that always comes up in C styling is the placement of
braces.  Unlike the indent size, there are few technical reasons to
choose one placement strategy over the other, but the preferred way, as
shown to us by the prophets Kernighan and Ritchie, is to put the opening
brace last on the line, and put the closing brace first, thusly:

	if (x is true) {
		we do y
	}

However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus:

	int function(int x)
	{
		body of function
	}

Note that the closing brace is empty on a line of its own, _except_ in
the cases where it is followed by a continuation of the same statement,
ie a "while" in a do-statement or an "else" in an if-statement, like
this:

	do {
		body of do-loop
	} while (condition);

and

	if (x == y) {
		..
	} else if (x > y) {
		...
	} else {
		....
	}

Also, note that this brace-placement also minimizes the number of empty
(or almost empty) lines, without any loss of readability.  Thus, as the
supply of new-lines on your screen is not a renewable resource (think
25-line terminal screens here), you have more empty lines to put
comments on. 

A rule has been defined in the top level Make.rules (which should be included
in all sub-makes) to assist in indenting and bracing. Invoke it by:

 make indent foo.c bar.h

The rule will also format C++ sources and headers in the same manner. By
default, blank lines will be removed except for one seperating functions and
those within comment blocks.


			Naming

C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be.  Unlike Modula-2
and Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like
ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter.  A C programmer would call that
variable "tmp", which is much easier to write, and not the least more
difficult to understand. 

HOWEVER, while mixed-case names are frowned upon, descriptive names for
global variables are a must.  To call a global function "foo" is a
shooting offense. 

GLOBAL variables (to be used only if you _really_ need them) need to
have descriptive names, as do global functions.  If you have a function
that counts the number of active users, you should call that
"count_active_users()" or similar, you should _not_ call it "cntusr()". 

Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian
notation) is brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and can
check those, and it only confuses the programmer.  No wonder MicroSoft
makes buggy programs. 

LOCAL variable names should be short, and to the point.  If you have
some random integer loop counter, it should probably be called "i". 
Calling it "loop_counter" is non-productive, if there is no chance of it
being mis-understood.  Similarly, "tmp" can be just about any type of
variable that is used to hold a temporary value. 

If you are afraid to mix up your local variable names, you have another
problem, which is called the function-growth-hormone-imbalance syndrome. 
See next chapter. 

		
			Functions

Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing.  They should
fit on one or two screenfuls of text (the ISO/ANSI screen size is 80x24,
as we all know), and do one thing and do that well. 

The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the
complexity and indentation level of that function.  So, if you have a
conceptually simple function that is just one long (but simple)
case-statement, where you have to do lots of small things for a lot of
different cases, it's OK to have a longer function. 

However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a
less-than-gifted first-year high-school student might not even
understand what the function is all about, you should adhere to the
maximum limits all the more closely.  Use helper functions with
descriptive names (you can ask the compiler to in-line them if you think
it's performance-critical, and it will probably do a better job of it
that you would have done). 

Another measure of the function is the number of local variables.  They
shouldn't exceed 5-10, or you're doing something wrong.  Re-think the
function, and split it into smaller pieces.  A human brain can
generally easily keep track of about 7 different things, anything more
and it gets confused.  You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like
to understand what you did 2 weeks from now. 


			Commenting

Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting.  NEVER
try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it's much better to
write the code so that the _working_ is obvious, and it's a waste of
time to explain badly written code. 

Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW.
A boxed comment describing the function, return value, and who calls it
placed above the body is good. 
Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the
function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it,
you should probably re-read the Functions section again.  You can make
small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or
ugly), but try to avoid excess.  Instead, put the comments at the head
of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does
it.

If comments along the lines of /* Fix me */ are used, please, please, say
why something needs fixing. When a change has been made to the affected
portion of code, either remove the comment, or amend it to indicate a 
change has been made and needs testing.


			Shell Scripts & Makefiles
			
Not everyone has the same tools and packages installed. Some people use
vi, others emacs - A few even avoid having either package installed,
prefering a lightweight text editor such as nano or the one built in to
Midnight Commander.

gawk versus mawk - Again, not everyone will have gawk installed, mawk is
nearly a tenth of the size and yet conforms to the Posix AWK standard. If
some obscure gawk specific command is needed that mawk does not provide,
than the script will break for some users. The same would apply to mawk.
In short, use the generic awk invocation in preference to gawk or mawk.


			CVS Notes

cvs is a very powerfull tool that many developers fail to use to it's full
potential. http://www.red-bean/cvsbook should be compulsory reading for
anyone wanting to use cvs. The chapters on tags, branching, and merging
can appear daunting at first, so should be read several times. Chapters 
covering administration, however, can be skipped.


			CVS Commit Comments

When committing a change or file to the repository, a short  note describing
the changes is helpfull for future reference. "A small bug fix to foo" is
more informative than a "." (which should be another shooting offense).


			CVS Tags

Tagging files within the cvs repository enables us to mark a set of files
with a specific marker. This provides a simple mechanism to retrive code
thus marked. The tags could indicate a stable version, or be a precursor to
branching. Apart from branch tags, the recommendation is to prefix all tags
with the developers initials.
Note: Tags prefixed with bdi or BDI are reserved for use in conjunction with
the Brain Dead Install project.


			C++ Conventions

C++ coding styles are always likely to end up in heated debates (a bit like
the emcacs versus vi arguments).  One thing is certain however, a common style
used by everyone working on a project leads to uniform and readable code.

Naming conventions:
Constants either from #defines or enumerations should be in upper case through
out.
Rational: Makes it easier to spot compile time consants in the source code.
 e.g. EMC_MESSAGE_TYPE

Classes and Namespaces should capitalise the first letter of each word and
avoid underscores.
Rational: Identifies classes, constructors and destructors.
 e.g. GtkWidget

Methods (or function names) should follow the C recommendations above and 
should not include the class name.
Rational: Maintains a common style across C and C++ sources.
 e.g. get_foo_bar()

However, boolean methods are easier to read if they avoid underscores and use
an 'is' prefix (not to be confused with methods that manipulate a boolean).
Rational: Identifies the return value as TRUE or FALSE and nothing else.
 e.g. isOpen, isHomed

Do NOT use "Not" in a boolean name, it leads only leads to confusion when doing
logical tests.
 e.g. isNotOnLimit or is_not_on_limit are BAD.

Variable names should avoid the use of upper case and underscores except for
local or private names. The use of global variables should be avoided as much
as possible.
Rational: Clarifies which are variables and which are methods.
Public:
 e.g. axislimit
Private:
 e.g. maxvelocity_

Specific method naming conventions

The terms get and set should be used where an attribute is accessed directly.
Rational: Indicates the purpose of the function or method.
 e.g. get_foo set_bar

For methods involving boolean attributes, set & reset is prefered.
Rational: As above.
 e.g. set_amp_enable reset_amp_fault

Math intensive methods should use compute as a prefix.
Rational: Shows that it is computationally intensive and will hog the CPU.
 e.g. compute_PID

Abbreviations in names should be avoided where possible - The exception is for
local variable names.
Rational: Clarity of code.
 e.g. pointer is prefered over ptr
      compute is prefered over cmp
      compare is again prefered over cmp.

Enumerates and other constants can be prefixed by a common type name
 e.g. enum COLOUR {
          COLOUR_RED,
	  COLOUR_BLUE
      };

Excessive use of macros and defines should be avoided - Using simple methods or
functions is prefered.
Rational: Improves the debugging process.

Include Statements
Header files must be included at the top of a source file and not scattered
throughout the body. They should be sorted and grouped by their hierarchical
position within the system with the low level files included first.
Include file paths should NEVER be absolute - Use the compiler -I flag instead.
Rational: Headers may not be in the same place on all systems.

Pointers and references should have their reference symbol next to the variable
name rather than the type name.
Rational: Reduces confusion.
  e.g. float *x or int &i

Implicit tests for zero should not be used except for boolean variables.
 e.g. if (spindle_speed != 0) NOT if (spindle_speed)

Only loop control statements must be included in a for() construct.
 e.g. sum = 0;
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          sum += value[i];
      }

NOT
      for (i = 0; sum =0; i < 10; i++) sum += value[i];

Likewise, executeable statements in conditionals must be avoided.
 e.g. if (fd = open(file_name) is bad.

Complex conditional statements should be avoided - Introduce temporary boolean
variables instead.

The form while(true) should be used for infinite loops.
 e.g. while (true) {
          ...;
      }

NOT

for (;;) {
    ...;
}

or

while (1) {
    ...;
}

Parentheses should be used in plenty in mathematial expresions - Do not rely
on operator precedence when an extra parentheses would clarify things.

File names: C++ sources and headers use .cc and .hh extension. The use of .c
and .h are reserved for plain C. Headers are for class, method, and structure
declarations, not code (unless the functions are declared inline).
