# readout of all relevant VF-S11 parameters via Modbus
#
# I setup my VFD as follows:
# - factory reset by choosing 'typ = 3' (full operations manual section 7.3)
# - set to european defaults 'typ = 1' (mostly switching 60->50Hz)
# 
# the I set parameters below 
# you can do this on the panel or with the PCS0012 windows utility from Toshiba.
# 
# The idea is that by default the panel is enabled
# when Modbus controls starts it takes over control with the control/frequency override
# in register FA00
# when Modbus quits, these override bits should be reset in the FA00 register
# or, even better, send a fault reset 
#
# ---- reading the parameter values:
# run this file as:
# modio <dump-params.mio >dump-myparams.log
#
# first, do a fault reset

# if the VFD isn't faulted, this seems a no-op
