/** The following data structures are used by the HAL but are not part
    of the HAL API and should not be visible to code that uses the HAL.
*/

/** At runtime, the HAL consists of a pile of interconnected data
    structures in a block of shared memory.  There are linked lists
    of components, pins, signals, parameters, functions, and threads.
    Most of the lists are sorted by name, and each of these lists is
    cross linked to the others.  All pins, parameters, functions, and
    threads are linked to the component that created them.  In addition,
    pins are linked to signals, and functions are linked to threads.
    On top of that, when items are deleted, they are stored in (you
    guessed it) linked lists for possible reuse later.

    As a result, the pointer manipulation needed to add or remove
    an item from the HAL gets a little complex and hard to follow.
    Sorry about that...  tread carefully, especially in the
    free_xxx_struct functions.  And mind your mutexes.

    And just to make it more fun: shared memory is mapped differently
    for each process and for the kernel, so you can't just pass pointers
    to shared memory objects from one process to another.  So we use
    integer offsets from the start of shared memory instead of pointers.
    In addition to adding overhead, this makes the code even harder to
    read.  Very annoying!  Like near/far pointers in the old days!
    In areas where speed is critical, we sometimes use both offsets
    (for general access) and pointers (for fast access by the owning
    component only).  The macros below are an attempt to neaten things
    up a little.

/* IMPORTANT:  If any of the structures in this file are changed, the
   version code (HAL_VER) must be incremented, to ensure that 
   incompatible utilities, etc, aren't used to manipulate data in
   shared memory.
*/

/* Historical note: in versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 of EMC, the key was
   0x48414C21, and instead of the structure starting with a version
   number, it started with a fixed magic number.  Mixing binaries or
   kernel modules from those releases with newer versions will result
   in two shmem regions being open, and really strange results (but 
   should _not_ result in segfaults or other crash type problems).
   This is unfortunate, but I can't retroactively make the old code
   detect version mismatches.  The alternative is worse: if the new
   code used the same shmem key, the result would be segfaults or
   kernel oopses.

   The use of version codes  means that any subsequent changes to
   the structs will be fully protected, with a clean shutdown and
   meaningful error messages in case of a mismatch.
