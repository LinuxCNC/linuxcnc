File changes for LinuxCNC classicladder 0.8.10 from original 0.8.10

These entries will only mention the changes regarding upstream, that means
that some of the previous entries that Chris Morley wrote, is still correct.
With that said, several of the functions that was implemented in LinuxCNC,
has later been included upstream, with some modifications, which is what most
of these changes in 0.8.10 actually is.

Backported from 0.9.113:
--- Mouse scroll functionality.
--- Minor changes related to GUI and open/save dialog.
--- Macros in 'classicladder_gtk.h', used for compatibility with GTK 2 and GTK 3.
--- Backport ShowMessageBoxError(), shorthand for displaying error messages.
--- Update to upstream localization strings where ours where missing.

global, some changes is quite old, but undocumented:
--- Function sprintf() has been changed to snprintf().
--- Almost all functions strcat() and strcpy() has been changed to rtapi_strxcat() and rtapi_strxcpy().
--- A lot of typo's has been fixed.
--- License header has been updated to reflect the new address.
--- Code related to log functionality has been commented out or not included.
--- Code related to hardware I/O is removed.

config_gtk.c:
--- CreateGeneralParametersPage() is slightly modified to make it more pretty,
    changes include alignment of text, some white space and margins.
--- Remove option for selecting '%I' to read to, with Modbus. The option
    is only removed from the GUI. Previously there was a comment in
    'protocol_modbus_master.c' in SetVarFromModbus(), which might mean that
    this was previously handled on a lower level.
--- Make config window narrower.

edit.c:
--- Comment out printf() in GetSizesOfAnElement(), spams a lot useless info
    when you copy a rung.

edit_copy.c:
--- comment out printf() in GetSizesOfTheSelectionToCopy(), creates a lot of
    useless info when you copy a rung.

emc_mods.c:
--- Check for NULL after call to ConvSymbolToVarName().
--- Cleaned up the entire file regarding whitespace and indentation.

files.c:
--- Settings related to general Modbus configuration and IO parameters has deviated from upstream.
    Upstream has saved general settings in a different section and used different words for IO parameters.
    We are using what we had previously to not break backward compatibility.

menu_and_toolbar.c:
--- Rename two menu entries, 'Watch Window' and 'Bit Status Window'.

protocol_modbus_master.c:
--- Add InitModbusMasterParams() last in InitModbusMasterBeforeReadConf().
    This was how it was done previously, and is needed for Modbus to properly
    start when running under LinuxCNC.

socket_modbus_master.c:
--- In InitSocketModbusMaster(), comment out InitModbusMasterParams(), this is
    moved to protocol_modbus_master.c in InitModbusMasterBeforeReadConf().

File changes for EMC classicladder 7.124 from original 7.124
Jan. 2007

arith_eval.c/.h:
--- backported fix from version 7.126 to fix a crash if variable number is not a number
--- changed printf to rtapi_print on line 414

arrays.c:
--- changed extensively. Removed most allocation code besides what EMC needs for realtime and user programs.
--- added #ifndef RTAPI around INCLUDE of files.h which caused error in realtime (no directory access in realtime)
--- this also means adding #ifndef RTAPI around 'CleanAndRemoveTmpDir' call in 'classicladder_free_all'
--- copy GeneralParams into GeneralParamsMirror (in user code only) so config window displays proper info
--- add CurentProjectFileName to infosgene array so filename is remembered when GUI is closed
--- add space for %E variables

Calc.c:
--- removed define for module and RTAI
--- removed and moved period calculation to module_hal.c
--- changed inputCountrol pin of old timers to be always true so it behaves as previous old timers. check out-CalcTypeTimer()

classicladder.c:
--- changed extensively. Removed most of initialization code besides what was added for HAL.
--- A config file can be loaded from the command line for modbus info *depreciated*
--- to use MODBUS master use --modmaster
--- to use MODBUS slave use --modslave
--- to set debug level for rtapi_print use --debug
--- if a program was loaded previously and you load classicladder again with a ladder program
    specified it will load it instead of ignoring it.
--- change to put CurrentProjectfileName into infosgene array
--- change to display ladder program name on section display window

classicladder.h:
--- small amount added. Add definitions for HAL s32 pins and For HAL support.
--- changed define for symbols comment length from 30 to 50 for long signal names
--- add defines for new variable %QW and %IW
--- added external variable modmaster
--- added NBR_PHYS_WORDS_INPUTS and NBR_PHYS_WORDS_OUTPUTS for support of %WQ and %IW variables
--- added CurrentProjectFileName[ 400 ] to StrInfosGene for Filename to be stored in shared mem
--- added defines etc for %E variables

classicladder gtk.c:
--- removed define for hardware.h
--- changed gtk_exit(0) to gtk_main_quit in function QuitAppliGtk() so program returns to where we called gtk_main in
--- run/stop and reset buttons send messages to statusbar
--- classicladder will ask to confirm quit and ( if running ) reset
--- classicladder warns you that modbus will stop if you quit GUI
--- change to display ladder program name on section display window
--- added CheckErrors() for checking %E variables so a error message can be displayed
--- added ShowErrorMessage() for same

config.c :
--- added printf so we know when a modbus config file is loading

config_gtk.c:
--- removed define for hardware.h
--- added #ifndef HAL_SUPPORT around any code for direct I/O to hide it from configure window
--- modified to show number of s32 in and out pins
--- modified modbus page to added options for read hold register, write register(s) and echo
--- if no modbus config is loaded then the modbus config page tells you this, otherwise it displays normally.
--- added a communication page for changing com settings radio buttons change settings immediately.
--- split the i/o page into two pages to improve size of config window
--- combine the i/o page back to one :)
--- add radio buttons for selecting variable that modbus maps to
--- add spin text entry selection for port name and port speed

drawing.c:
--- added colour to variable names for input (red) and output (blue) in section display drawing area
