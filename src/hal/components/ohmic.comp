component ohmic "LinuxCNC HAL component that uses a Mesa THCAD for ohmic sensing";

description
"""
Mesa THCAD Card component to scale input and outputs from the Mesa THCAD2, THCAD5, THCAD10, and THCAD300 cards.
.br
Allows user configurable voltage thresholds for ohmic sensing.

Output pins are provided for:
.br
ohmic-volts -the voltage sensed on ohmic sensing.
.br
thcad-volts -the actual voltage measured by the THCAD.
.br
ohmic-on    -true if ohmic-volts >= ohmic-threshold, false if ohmic-volts <= ohmic-low.

A THCAD-5 would often be used for ohmic sensing in conjunction with a 24 Volt isolated power supply and a 390 kÎ© series resistor resulting in a voltage divider of 4.9.
.br
This would result in a full scale reading of 24.5 Volts which is above the power supply output voltage.
.br
The circuit will remain protected by the THCAD's ability to tolerate a 500 Volt over-voltage indefinitely.
.br
It is optional that power to the ohmic sensing circuit be disconnected unless probing is in progress.

examples """
.br
The below HAL example assumes a THCAD5 card using a 1/32 frequency setting and a voltage divider internal to the plasma cutter with range extended to 24.5 volts by a series 390K external resistor as per the manual.
Additional information and wiring diagram is contained in the Plasma Primer in the LinuxCNC documentation.
.br
Example Calibration Data: 0V = 122.9 kHz, 10V = 925.7 kHz should be entered as 122900 and 925700.
