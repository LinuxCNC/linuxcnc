description """
HAL component that implements a safety latch for error signals
with customizable harm, healing and latching features.

When the component is not enabled the error input value is
forwarded to output without further modififactions.

If error-in is true the error count is increased by harm.
If error-in is false the error count is decreased by heal.
When the error count exceeds the threscold value error-out is
set to true. If latching is false the error-out pin will only
return to false when reset is set to true.

The inputs pin min and max clamp the error count value to a
specified range.
