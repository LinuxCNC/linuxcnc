/** This file, 'stepgen.c', is a HAL component that provides software
    based step pulse generation.  The maximum step rate will depend
    on the speed of the PC, but is expected to exceed 5KHz for even
    the slowest computers, and may reach 25KHz on fast ones.  It is
    a realtime component.

    It supports up to 16 pulse generators.  Each generator can produce
    several types of outputs in addition to step/dir, including
    quadrature, half- and full-step unipolar and bipolar, three phase,
    and five phase.  A 32 bit feedback value is provided indicating
    the current position of the motor in counts (assuming no lost
    steps), and a floating point feedback in user specified position
    units is also provided.

    The number of step generators and type of outputs is determined
    by the insmod command line parameter 'step_type'.  It accepts
    a comma separated (no spaces) list of up to 16 stepping types
    to configure up to 16 channels.  A second command line parameter
    "ctrl_type", selects between position and velocity control modes
    for each step generator.  (ctrl_type is optional, the default
    control type is position.)

    So a command line like this:

	insmod stepgen step_type=0,0,1,2  ctrl_type=p,p,v,p

    will install four step generators, two using stepping type 0,
    one using type 1, and one using type 2.  The first two and 
    the last one will be running in position mode, and the third
    one will be running in velocity mode.

    The driver exports three functions.  'stepgen.make-pulses', is
    responsible for actually generating the step pulses.  It must
    be executed in a fast thread to reduce pulse jitter.  The other
    two functions are normally called from a much slower thread.
    'stepgen.update-freq' reads the position or frequency command
    and sets internal variables used by 'stepgen.make-pulses'.
    'stepgen.capture-position' captures and scales the current
    values of the position feedback counters.  Both 'update-freq' and
    'capture-position' use floating point, 'make-pulses' does not.

    Polarity:

    All signals from this module have fixed polarity (active high
    in most cases).  If the driver needs the opposite polarity,
    the signals can be inverted using parameters exported by the
    hardware driver(s) such as ParPort.

    Timing parameters:

    There are five timing parameters which control the output waveform.
    No step type uses all five, and only those which will be used are
    exported to HAL.  The values of these parameters are in nano-seconds,
    so no recalculation is needed when changing thread periods.  In
    the timing diagrams that follow, they are identfied by the
    following numbers:

    (1): 'stepgen.n.steplen' = length of the step pulse
    (2): 'stepgen.n.stepspace' = minimum space between step pulses
	  (actual space depends on frequency command, and is infinite
	  if the frequency command is zero)
    (3): 'stepgen.n.dirhold' = minimum delay after a step pulse before
	  a direction change - may be longer
    (4): 'stepgen.n.dirsetup' = minimum delay after a direction change
	  and before the next step - may be longer
    (5): 'stepgen.n.dirdelay' = minimum delay after a step before a
	 step in the opposite direction - may be longer

    Stepping Types:

    This module supports a number of stepping types, as follows:

    Type 0:  Step and Direction
               _____         _____               _____
    STEP  ____/     \_______/     \_____________/     \______
              |     |       |     |             |     |
    Time      |-(1)-|--(2)--|-(1)-|--(3)--|-(4)-|-(1)-|
                                          |__________________
    DIR   ________________________________/

    There are two output pins, STEP and DIR.  Step pulses appear on
    STEP.  A positive frequency command results in DIR low, negative
    frequency command means DIR high.  The minimum period of the
    step pulses is 'steplen' + 'stepspace', and the frequency
    command is clamped to avoid exceeding these limits.  'steplen'
    and 'stepspace' must both be non-zero.  'dirsetup' or 'dirhold'
    may be zero, but their sum must be non-zero, to ensure non-zero
    low time between the last up step and the first down step.

    Type 1:  Up/Down
             _____       _____
    UP    __/     \_____/     \________________________________
            |     |     |     |         |
    Time    |-(1)-|-(2)-|-(1)-|---(5)---|-(1)-|-(2)-|-(1)-|
                                        |_____|     |_____|
    DOWN  ______________________________/     \_____/     \____


    There are two output pins, UP and DOWN.  A positive frequency
    command results in pulses on UP, negative frequency command
    results in pulses on DOWN.  The minimum period of the step
    pulses is 'steplen' + 'stepspace', and the frequency command
    is clamped to avoid exceeding these limits.  'steplen',
    'stepspace', and 'dirdelay' must all be non-zero.

    Types 2 and higher:  State Patterns

    STATE   |---1---|---2---|---3---|----4----|---3---|---2---|
            |       |       |       |         |       |       |
    Time    |--(1)--|--(1)--|--(1)--|--(1+5)--|--(1)--|--(1)--|

    All the remaining stepping types are simply different repeating
    patterns on two to five output pins.  When a step occurs, the
    output pins change to the next (or previous) pattern in the
    state listings that follow.  The output pins are called 'PhaseA'
    thru 'PhaseE'.  Timing constraints are obeyed as indicated
    in the drawing above.  'steplen' must be non-zero.  'dirdelay'
    may be zero.  Because stepspace is not used, state based
    stepping types can run faster than types 0 and 1.

    State   Phase A   Phase B
