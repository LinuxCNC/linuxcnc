description """
The 'Charge Pump' should be added to the base thread function.
When enabled the output is on for one period and off for one period. To calculate the
frequency of the output 1/(period time in seconds x 2) = Hz. For example if you
have a base period of 100,000ns that is 0.0001 seconds and the formula would be
1/(0.0001 x 2) = 5,000 Hz or 5 kHz. Two additional outputs are provided that run
a factor of 2 and 4 slower for hardware that requires a lower frequency.""";
