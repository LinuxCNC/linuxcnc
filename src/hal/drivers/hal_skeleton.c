/** This file, 'hal_skeleton.c', is a example that shows how
 drivers for HAL components will work and serve as a skeleton
 for new hardware drivers.
 
 Most of this code is taken from the hal_parport driver from John Kasunich,
 which is also a good starting point for new drivers.

 This driver supports only for demonstration how to write a byte (char)
 to a hardware address, here we use the parallel port (0x378).

 This driver support no configuration strings so installing is easy:
 realtime: halcmd loadrt hal_skeleton

 The driver creates a HAL pin and if it run in realtime a function
 as follows:

 Pin: 'skeleton.<portnum>.pin-<pinnum>-out'
 Function: 'skeleton.<portnum>.write'

 This skeleton driver also doesn't use arguments you can pass to the driver
 at startup. Please look at the parport driver how to implement this if you need
 this for your driver.

 (added 17 Nov 2006)
 The approach used for writing HAL drivers has evolved quite a bit over the
 three years since this was written.  Driver writers should consult the HAL
 User Manual for information about canonical device interfaces, and should
 examine some of the more complex drivers, before using this as a basis for
 a new driver.
