Demo for HAL ringbuffer functions
---------------------------------

HAL ring buffers support non-blocking, variable-sized record queue
operations between HAL components. The underlying model is a
lock-free, single-reader, single-writer queue which does not require
any operating system support and is extremely fast.

In the linuxCNC context, HAL ringbuffers are intended to replace a
variety of special-purpose messaging schemes like the ones used
between task and motion, in halstreamer, halsampler and halscope, at
the same time making those amenable to a networked messaging
integration.
