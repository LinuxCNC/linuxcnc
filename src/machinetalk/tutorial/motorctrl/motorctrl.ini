[HALTALK]
# XPUB socket publishing HAL group updates via STP
# by default, haltalk binds to an ephemeral port and localhost
# the resulting zeroMQ DSN is then announced via zeroconf:
# see http://api.zeromq.org/4-1:zmq-tcp for details on zeroMQ DSN's

# default to local operation, use next free TCP port number (aka 'ephemeral'):
# like if set so:
#GROUP_STATUS_URI=tcp://127.0.0.1:*
#RCOMP_STATUS_URI=tcp://127.0.0.1:*
#COMMAND_URI=tcp://127.0.0.1:*

# to bind to a specific port, a specific interface
# and disable service discovery, specify like here:
#RCOMP_STATUS_URI=tcp://eth1:1234

# ---- NB: do not use wildcard IP address binding like so: ---
# STATUS=tcp://*:1234
# the resulting zeroMQ DSN is tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 which cannot be connected to
# from a client

# zmq trace - set to 5 to see lots of trace
DEBUG=0


# default group timer, used if the group timer isnt set explicity
# in a group
# default value = 100mS
#GROUPTIMER=100
