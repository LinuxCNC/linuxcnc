This directory contains all code and build support for Google protobuf
for use in LinuxCNC, and the Universal Message Header format
specification plus some examples.

Protobuf Bindings:
------------------

Currently built are:

- the Python bindings by means of protoc as found here: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
- the C++ bindings by means of protoc as above
- the C bindings by means of protoc-c as found here: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/
- the C bindings by means of nanopb : http://code.google.com/p/nanopb

The Python, C++, and protoc-c C bindings are 'general purpose' Linux userland usage.

The nanopb bindings serve two additional purposes:

- they work fine in kernel modules since there are minimal prerequisites,
  and also very small code size. See hal/components/pbring.comp for an example.
- they work on embedded devices, like an AVR, and can be compiled with a cross compiler
  like avr-gcc.

All protobufs message formats should go under src/protobuf/proto and
are assumed to have a .proto extension.

For the C and C++ bindings, all message formats are compiled and built
into the following libraries:

 C bindings: lib/liblinuxcnc-pb2.so
 C++ bindings: lib/liblinuxcnc-pb2++.so
 Nanopb C bindings, userland library build: liblinuxcnc-npb.so.0
 Python bindings: lib/python/<message>_pb2.py
  (corresponding to src/protobuf/proto/<message>.proto)

Nanopb RT module support
------------------------

To en/decode protobuf messages in RT comps (kernel or userland), the
nanopb library and all message bindings are compile into two loadable
modules, nanopb and pbmsgs. These modules can be loaded with 'loadrt
nanopb' and 'loadrt pbmsgs' but their only purpuse is to export
functions to the RTAPI environment; they are not HAL components
proper.

This building takes place in protobuf/components.

Using examples can be found under hal/msgcomponents.


Include files:
--------------

C bindings:  #include "message.pb-c.h"  // to reference message.proto
C++ bindings:  #include "message.pb.h"
Nanopb C bindings:  #include "message.npb.h"  // to reference message.proto

and link to the appropriate library.

Python:  import message_pb2

To use a protobuf Message (using the Command message as example):

Python:  see src/protobuf/example/encode-decode.py
C++: src/protobuf/example/encdec.cc and the Makefile therein
C:  src/protobuf/mgsheader/wireformat.c and the Makefile therein


    NB: the current message formats in src/protobuf/proto are just
    examples to support src/hal/halreport and have no bearing on
    eventual messages for production use.

Messaging to/from HAL components:
--------------------------------

The experimental pbring component shows how RT components may receive
or send protobuf-encoded messages through HAL rings. This works for
all thread styles, user land or kernel, user or RT.

This means protobuf messaging can be used end-to-end without any
transcoding (like for instance is done now between task and motion).

To try it out:

 $ halcmd -f pbring-demo.hal
 $ python pbring-demo.py

Note this enables simple piping of protobuf text format messages into
an application like pbring-demo.py - one could paste such a message
into a web window, push 'submit' and the output will not only
converted automatically/type-checked to the wire format - the
recipient component actually understands that wire format; there is no
necessity for 'clever intermediaries' anymore.

So finally RT component interaction comes back home to the Unix shell
- you can write motion commands in an editor, and pipe them into the
realtime system - and have humanly readable responses too!

This potentially extends to embedded devices like AVR's or PIC's as
well since the nanopb bindings have a very small memory footprint. It
is entirely feasible to hook such a microcontroller over, say, SPI
into HAL/RTAPI and communicate through protobuf messages carried over
SPI. (fill in USB, CAN, I2C etc for SPI as needed).

example footprint for the nanopb decode and encode library functions
for AVR's:

 $ avr-gcc -I. -c *.c
 $ avr-size *.o
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   7480	    242	      0	   7722	   1e2a	pb_decode.o
   5016	     14	      0	   5030	   13a6	pb_encode.o

The message descriptor files are much smaller, in the 10s to 100s of
bytes per .proto file.

HAL Rings:
For a description of HAL ring theory and C API see the
src/hal/hal-ring directory.  There are also some basic ring examples
using C and Python, and demo RT components (ringload, ringwrite,
ringread plus matching .hal files).


Encoding/decoding using Python
------------------------------

src/protobuf/examples/encode-decode.py shows how to:

- create Python protobuf message object and set attributes
- convert that to and from wireline format
- convert that to and from the Protobuf text format
- convert that to and from a JSON encoding  (thanks to Pavel Shramov)

all conversions entail the strict protobuf type checking against the
underlying .proto file. Note also JSON messages are be fully
typechecked.

you might need to:  apt-get install python-simplejson

Encoding/decoding in C++
------------------------
see src/protobuf/examples/encdec.cc - it does:

- encode a protobuf message
- convert to text format
- parse from string

Example C protobuf application
------------------------------

See src/hal/halreport - this uses the HAL group mechanism to report
signal changes. halreport links against the C bindings library
(lib/liblinuxcnc-pb2.so) generated in this directory.

A matching Gladevcp demo application using protobufs can be found in
src/hal/halreport/zmqdemo.py. This uses the Python bindings, also
generated in this directory.


Universal header format
-----------------------
Specification is in src/protobuf/mgsheader/README .

To use the universal header from C/C++, include "msgheader.h" .

A Python header packing/unpacking example is in src/protobuf/mgsheader/header.py .
