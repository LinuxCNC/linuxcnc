emc2 (1:2.1.0) testing; urgency=low

  * Prepare for release
  * AXIS debug level dialog. Users can now choose verbosity directly from AXIS
  * HAL driver & sample config for the pluto FPGA board
  * AXIS home-all and pyvcp support
  * 'unobtainable step rate' error message. when the user requests a
    velocity which is too high (improper config) this gets reported as
    a warning during startup.
  * streamer (component for data passing from realtime to userspace)
  * removed HAL types s8, u8, s16, and u16.  HAL now uses float for
    analog values, bit for booleans, and s32 or u32 for integer values.
    The only users who will be affected are those with Universal Stepper
    Controller cards.  See item 9 at
    http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?UpdatingConfigurationsForDevelopmentVersions
  * merged classicladder 0.7.100
  * added a feed-hold HAL pin.  Added M codes to enable/disable feed
    override, spindle override, feed hold, and adaptive feed individually.
    Feed override is M50, spindle override is M51, adaptive feed is M52,
    and feed hold is M53.  G50/51 are no longer used to enable/disable
    adaptive feed, use M52 instead.
  * added support for block delete as defined by Section 2.2.2 in the
    RS274NGC_3 specs.
  * added support for optional program stop as defined by Section 2.2.3
    in the RS274NGC_3 specs.
  * manpages have been created for most rtapi and hal calls
  * added a userspace simulator which includes rtapi threads.
    Use "--enable-simulator" to enable this mode, which cannot
    be used to control real hardware
  * added support to optionally save joint positions between
    runs ([TRAJ] POSITION_FILE = position.txt)
  * added support to specify UNITS in literal in the ini.
    (e.g. [TRAJ] LINEAR_UNITS = mm )
  * fixed bug #1384883, optional stop was not optional.
  * AXIS is now a part of EMC2, not a separate source download.
  * Added a spindle-speed override. This allows to override the spindle
    speed during a program run. The MIN_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE and
    MAX_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE in the ini assure that speed doesn't get
    reduced or increased too much. 1.0 is 100%, just like feed override
  * Documentation can be built from source with the 'make docs' target
  * added realtime support for jogwheels.  Three HAL pins per axis:
    one accepts raw counts from the wheel, one sets the distance moved
    per count, and one enables that axis to move.
  * added 'adaptive feed', a HAL pin that can be used to scale the
    feedrate in real time.  Simular to feedrate override, but can
    only vary from 0.0 to 1.0, and reacts much faster.  Intended
    for use with EDM and other applications that require closed
    loop control of feedrate.
  * contouring performance is improved when using tolerance mode (G64 Pxxx)
  * G76 multipass threading cycle for lathes
  * lathe tool shape compensation and offsets
  * AXIS gui draws the lathe tool shape as described in the tool table
  * index pulse support for the PPMC family (for homing and spindle sensing)
  * "extra DAC" support for some PPMC cards
  * added FF2 (acceleration feedforward) to PID
  * new sample configs including a torch height controller and lathes
  * regression test infrastructure
  * emcrsh, a telnet based user interface
  * xemc and keystick user interfaces for low-powered computers
  * kinematics are loaded as modules, eliminating the need for recompiling
  * support for safe homing when several home switches to the same input pin
  * a "home all" message that homes the axes together or in a particular order
  * axis_manualtoolchange, which prompts the user to change the tool when
    the standard M6 is encountered in the program
  * AXIS configurable filtering, where an input file can be run through a
    filter to create gcode automatically
  * some example AXIS input filters for images and python code, and example
    inputs
  * readline support in halcmd
  * "net" HAL command which can simplify HAL files by replacing a "newsig"
    and several "link" commands with one command
  * "pwmgen" HAL component to make PWM generation simpler
  * leadscrew compensation
  * improved backlash compensation
  * many new inputs and outputs in halui
  * parallel port "X mode" (control port as inputs) which works on some
    hardware.  this gives a nice combination of 8 outputs and 9 inputs.
  * many improvements in presentation and usability in halscope
  * the configuration picker allows you to automatically copy a sample
    configuration to your home directory and/or create a launching icon
    on the desktop

 -- Chris Radek <chris@timeguy.com>  Wed,  2 Aug 2006 21:51:29 -0500

emc2 (1:2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * add probe_parport module for machines with plug-and-play parports that
    require initialization before working
  * fix velocity and acceleration in teleop mode (non-trivial kinematics
    machines only)
  * fix G33's K word to use programmed G20/G21 units as appropriate
  * fix possible error when halcmd's output is piped to a program

emc2 (1:2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * several fixes for blending of very short segments
  * fix for occasional following error while decelerating after abort
  * stop jogs a bit short of the soft limits to make sure they are never
    reached
  * fix to honor [TASK]CYCLE_TIME which was being ignored
  * fix to remove spurious limit-exceeded warning when homing on a limit
    switch
  * double the size of the hal shared memory block for very complex hal
    configurations like on the Mazak at CNC workshop
  * fix some tmp file handling in classicladder
  * now stepper systems recover correctly after following errors
    (previously turning the machine back on often caused another following
    error)
  * fix a tkemc blocky font that appeared on some X servers
  * EMC now verifies that it has exclusive access to the parallel port.
    This solves many possible problems including overnight cron jobs
    that interfere with the parallel port.  If EMC can't get exclusive
    access, it will now correctly abort with an error.  THE 2.0.1 PACKAGE
    ALSO DISABLES THE parport_pc KERNEL MODULE, BY ADDING A FILE
    IN /etc/modprobe.d/.  THIS WILL DISABLE PARALLEL PORT PRINTERS.

emc2 (TESTING-2006-04-09) testing; urgency=low

  * Modified the motion control module to behave more like
    other HAL modules - it no longer adds its functions to threads
    automatically.  All the sample configs have been changed to explicitly
    add the functions. USERS WHO HAVE CUSTOM CONFIGS WILL NEED TO DO
    THE SAME.
  * change all PERIOD specifications from seconds to nanoseconds.  USERS WHO
    HAVE CUSTOM CONFIGS WILL NEED TO DO THE SAME.
  * Standardize on all drivers dividing counts by input scale. formerly,
    some divided by the scale and some multiplied.  USERS MAY HAVE TO FIX
    THIS SCALE IN ANY CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS.
  * A new pin "count" exists for freqgen.  It is the same as the internal
    symbol "count" show in the hal introduction pdf.
  * A bug in the univpwm ini's fourth axis is fixed
  * There is a new sim_encoder hal object that takes as input a speed and
    generates simulated quadrature and index pulse output.
  * Fix misreporting of the current feed rate in the GUI: even though the
    machine still moved at the correct rate, the reported number was sometimes
    off by a factor of 25.4.
  * Add the beginnings of halui, an extensible way to run EMC using a real
    front panel (switches/knobs/encoders).
  * Standardize on an encoder index pulse being called phase Z, not I
  * Bugfix to make the STG dacs come up initially at 0v, not -10v, for the
    first msec
  * Support variable substitutions in the hal file from the ini.  the format
    is [INI_SECTION]INI_VARIABLE

  * M6 now correctly causes an error if there is no prepped tool (Txx)
  * the STG sample ini file had two mm axes and one inch; now they are all mm.
  * the STG driver multipiled by INPUT_SCALE instead of dividing like the rest
    of the HAL drivers; this is fixed.
