emc2 (1:2.4.2) lucid; urgency=low

  * axis: fix crash when environment variable AXIS_NO_HAL is set

  * classicladder: modbus reliability and performance improvements

  * components: fix tan(), atan() implementations.  Before, using these
    functions would make all math in realtime components behave unpredictably.
  * comp: fix repeated MODULE_LICENSE declarations

  * documentation: many improvements

  * emccalib: fix crash 'unmatched open quote in list' for lines like
      loadrt hal_parport cfg="0x378 out  "

  * emcrsh: fix crash when invoked with a bad commandline

  * emcsh: report effect tool offsets on all axes
  * emcsh: enable emc_tool_offset to access all tool offsets
  * emcsh: fix wrong conversion of ABC axis values as though they were
    linear axes

  * gcode: fix a problem with inverse time mode and m66 leading to very slow
    moves
  * gcode: save state of g92 across runs.  In the first run after upgrading
    to 2.4.2, g92 will be disabled.  In subsequent runs, the state of g92
    at startup will be the the same one stored in the var file at shutdown.
  * gcode: fix G1 followed by G5, G5.x
  * gcode: improve accuracy of NURBS paths.  An important calculation of the
    direction of a NURBS path at a given point has been improved.  This makes
    the resulting path more closely follow the mathematically precise NURBS
    curve.
  * gcode: improve accuracy of G5, G5.1 spline paths by converting them to
    NURBS paths.
  * gcode: detect missing P, Q words with G5
  * gcode: avoid division by zero in NURBS

  * hal_input: fix keys and buttons with unknown names

  * image-to-gcode: fix crash when using lace bounding

  * mesa: fix failure to load firmwares on 7i43
  * mesa: fix failure to load firmwares on 5i23, 3x20, and other PLX9054-based
    cards
  * mesa: fix stepgen slowly moving in negative direction, losing position
  * mesa: fix stepgen mode setting problem

  * motion: fix threading and tapping with spindle turning backward (M4)

  * pncconf: mesa 3x20 support
  * pncconf: write configuration files without "base thread".  This may improve
    behavior on step&direction systems configured with pncconf.
  * pncconf: many additional bugfixes

  * pickconfig: fix icon for desktop shortcuts
  * pickconfig: fix permissions on desktop shortcuts
  * pickconfig: don't allow user to run sample configuration without copying.
    This has not worked right for a long time, so there's no value in offering
    the option.

  * ppmc: improve error message when no board is present
  * ppmc: fix board detection when cooperating with linux parport_pc driver

  * sample configurations:
   * ppmc: sample configs now use axis user interface
   * ppmc: hal samples for spindle speed display, pendant
   * smithy: 1240 and 622leadshine sample configuration improvements

  * sample gcode:
   * lathe_pawn: set radius mode in startup codes

  * stepgen: fix ctrl_type for kernels 2.6.30 and newer

    boards: 5i20, 5i22, 5i23, 4i65, 4i68, and 7i43.  PCI users should
    switch from hm2_5i20 to hm2_pci driver.
  * hostmot2 changes: Config changes required!  pwmgen.scale now works as
    advertised; stepgen timing params are "u32 ns" instead of "float
    seconds"; and stepgens now have a .enable pin which needs setting.
  * hostmot2 feature additions: Added PDM mode for pwmgen; PWM and PDM
    frequency are now settable by the user; implemented stepgen maxaccel
    and maxvel; support open-drain GPIOs; all GPIOs now have some
    representation in HAL (though the ones used by module instances are
    restricted); encoder improvements.
  * Lots of hostmot2 bug fixes, mostly with pwmgen and stepgen.  Thanks to
    all the brave testers!

emc2 (1:2.1.0) testing; urgency=low

  * Prepare for release
  * AXIS debug level dialog. Users can now choose verbosity directly from AXIS
  * HAL driver & sample config for the pluto FPGA board
  * AXIS home-all and pyvcp support
  * 'unobtainable step rate' error message. when the user requests a
    velocity which is too high (improper config) this gets reported as
    a warning during startup.
  * streamer (component for data passing from realtime to userspace)
  * removed HAL types s8, u8, s16, and u16.  HAL now uses float for
    analog values, bit for booleans, and s32 or u32 for integer values.
    The only users who will be affected are those with Universal Stepper
    Controller cards.  See item 9 at
    http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?UpdatingConfigurationsForDevelopmentVersions
  * merged classicladder 0.7.100
  * added a feed-hold HAL pin.  Added M codes to enable/disable feed
    override, spindle override, feed hold, and adaptive feed individually.
    Feed override is M50, spindle override is M51, adaptive feed is M52,
    and feed hold is M53.  G50/51 are no longer used to enable/disable
    adaptive feed, use M52 instead.
  * added support for block delete as defined by Section 2.2.2 in the
    RS274NGC_3 specs.
  * added support for optional program stop as defined by Section 2.2.3
    in the RS274NGC_3 specs.
  * manpages have been created for most rtapi and hal calls
  * added a userspace simulator which includes rtapi threads.
    Use "--enable-simulator" to enable this mode, which cannot
    be used to control real hardware
  * added support to optionally save joint positions between
    runs ([TRAJ] POSITION_FILE = position.txt)
  * added support to specify UNITS in literal in the ini.
    (e.g. [TRAJ] LINEAR_UNITS = mm )
  * fixed bug #1384883, optional stop was not optional.
  * AXIS is now a part of EMC2, not a separate source download.
  * Added a spindle-speed override. This allows to override the spindle
    speed during a program run. The MIN_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE and
    MAX_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE in the ini assure that speed doesn't get
    reduced or increased too much. 1.0 is 100%, just like feed override
  * Documentation can be built from source with the 'make docs' target
  * added realtime support for jogwheels.  Three HAL pins per axis:
    one accepts raw counts from the wheel, one sets the distance moved
    per count, and one enables that axis to move.
  * added 'adaptive feed', a HAL pin that can be used to scale the
    feedrate in real time.  Simular to feedrate override, but can
    only vary from 0.0 to 1.0, and reacts much faster.  Intended
    for use with EDM and other applications that require closed
    loop control of feedrate.
  * contouring performance is improved when using tolerance mode (G64 Pxxx)
  * G76 multipass threading cycle for lathes
  * lathe tool shape compensation and offsets
  * AXIS gui draws the lathe tool shape as described in the tool table
  * index pulse support for the PPMC family (for homing and spindle sensing)
  * "extra DAC" support for some PPMC cards
  * added FF2 (acceleration feedforward) to PID
  * new sample configs including a torch height controller and lathes
  * regression test infrastructure
  * emcrsh, a telnet based user interface
  * xemc and keystick user interfaces for low-powered computers
  * kinematics are loaded as modules, eliminating the need for recompiling
  * support for safe homing when several home switches to the same input pin
  * a "home all" message that homes the axes together or in a particular order
  * axis_manualtoolchange, which prompts the user to change the tool when
    the standard M6 is encountered in the program
  * AXIS configurable filtering, where an input file can be run through a
    filter to create gcode automatically
  * some example AXIS input filters for images and python code, and example
    inputs
  * readline support in halcmd
  * "net" HAL command which can simplify HAL files by replacing a "newsig"
    and several "link" commands with one command
  * "pwmgen" HAL component to make PWM generation simpler
  * leadscrew compensation
  * improved backlash compensation
  * many new inputs and outputs in halui
  * parallel port "X mode" (control port as inputs) which works on some
    hardware.  this gives a nice combination of 8 outputs and 9 inputs.
  * many improvements in presentation and usability in halscope
  * the configuration picker allows you to automatically copy a sample
    configuration to your home directory and/or create a launching icon
    on the desktop

emc2 (TESTING-2006-04-09) testing; urgency=low

  * Modified the motion control module to behave more like
    other HAL modules - it no longer adds its functions to threads
    automatically.  All the sample configs have been changed to explicitly
    add the functions. USERS WHO HAVE CUSTOM CONFIGS WILL NEED TO DO
    THE SAME.
  * change all PERIOD specifications from seconds to nanoseconds.  USERS WHO
    HAVE CUSTOM CONFIGS WILL NEED TO DO THE SAME.
  * Standardize on all drivers dividing counts by input scale. formerly,
    some divided by the scale and some multiplied.  USERS MAY HAVE TO FIX
    THIS SCALE IN ANY CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS.
  * A new pin "count" exists for freqgen.  It is the same as the internal
    symbol "count" show in the hal introduction pdf.
  * A bug in the univpwm ini's fourth axis is fixed
  * There is a new sim_encoder hal object that takes as input a speed and
    generates simulated quadrature and index pulse output.
  * Fix misreporting of the current feed rate in the GUI: even though the
    machine still moved at the correct rate, the reported number was sometimes
    off by a factor of 25.4.
  * Add the beginnings of halui, an extensible way to run EMC using a real
    front panel (switches/knobs/encoders).
  * Standardize on an encoder index pulse being called phase Z, not I
  * Bugfix to make the STG dacs come up initially at 0v, not -10v, for the
    first msec
  * Support variable substitutions in the hal file from the ini.  the format
    is [INI_SECTION]INI_VARIABLE
  * Logging of data from halscope (unfinished)
  * Some translation fixes for german
  * Enhancements to the editor in the mini GUI
  * emccalib, an online tuning editor
  * Sample configuration for a servo-driven etch-a-sketch using a very simple
    servo driver
  * Some fixes to the m5i20 sample configuration
  * Add new simulation configuration with simulated motors and encoders
  * Fix tool load loopback in the stg sample configuration
  * New hal joystick driver
  * New manpages for hal_joystick and halmeter
  * Very preliminary threading (spindle synchronized motion) support
  * Minor look-and-feel fixes in halmeter, halscope
  * Many internationalization fixes
  * Some copyright messages updated
  * New "max" sample configuration for experimenting with threading code
  * install i18n support for lots of the tcl programs including tkemc/mini

  * the mini GUI has a fix in font handling (for the large XYZ readout)
  * M6 now correctly causes an error if there is no prepped tool (Txx)
  * the STG sample ini file had two mm axes and one inch; now they are all mm.
  * the STG driver multipiled by INPUT_SCALE instead of dividing like the rest
    of the HAL drivers; this is fixed.
  * a bug that allowed G1 with no feed rate after a G0 is fixed
  * support passing an initial program to load, for AXIS
