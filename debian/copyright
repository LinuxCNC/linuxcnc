Comment: 
 Much of LinuxCNC is derived from EMC1, a work of Fred Proctor, Tom Kramer,
 Will Shackleford, and others.  That work was originally released into
 the public domain.  It was used as the basis of LinuxCNC, but received
 extensive modifications.  LinuxCNC is NOT public domain.  Anyone wishing
 to use the public domain code in a way that is not compatible with the
 (L)GPL must locate the original EMC1 code - they may NOT use LinuxCNC.

 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN
 AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
    and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
    an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
    such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms
    or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
    listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate
    and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled
    into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
    not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes
    of this License.
 c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the
    Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher;
    and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts,
    the organization that transmits the broadcast.
 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
    terms of this License including without limitation any production
    in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
    the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such
    as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon
    or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
    work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving
    or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed
    by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means
    or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
    to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage
    of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
    electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
    more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
    could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
 in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
    i   Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
        in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
        in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
        the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
        You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability
    of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
    and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
    the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
    Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
    the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
    terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If
    You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
    to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
    required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
    to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
    for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
    notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
    such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
    to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
    by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of
    these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt,
    You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
    of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
    rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
    assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
    by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
    express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor
    and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE
 OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
    License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
    Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
    licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
    full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
    the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work
    at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
    to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
    continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
    this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
    Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
    of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
    1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation
    of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright
    law includes additional rights not granted under this License,
    such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
    this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
    under applicable law.
