//! The vertex of the parabola is the "Location" point of the

//! The "XAxis" of the parabola is its axis of symmetry.
//! The "Xaxis" is oriented from the vertex of the parabola to the

//! The equation of the parabola in the local coordinate system is
//! Y**2 = (2*P) * X
//! P is the distance between the focus and the directrix of the

//! The focal length F = P/2 is the distance between the vertex
