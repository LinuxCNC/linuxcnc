//! This algorithm  is used to  compute the transition
//! of a 3D surface intersecting a topological surfacic
//! boundary on a 3D curve ( intersection curve ).
//! The  boundary is  described  by a  set of faces
//! each face is described by
//! - its support surface,
//! - an orientation defining its matter side.
//! The geometric elements are described locally at the
//! intersection point by a second order development.
//! A surface is described by the normal vector, the
//! principal directions and the principal curvatures.
//! A curve is described  by the  tangent, the normal
//! and the curvature.
//! The  algorithm  keeps track of the two faces elements
//! closest to the part of the curve "before" and "after"
//! the intersection,  these  two elements are updated
//! for each new face.
//! The position of the  curve can be computed when at
//! least  one surface  element has   been given, this
//! position is "In","Out" or "On" for the part of the
//! curve "Before" or "After" the intersection.
