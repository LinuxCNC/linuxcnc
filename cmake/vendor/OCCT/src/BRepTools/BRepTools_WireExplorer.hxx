//! The WireExplorer is a tool to explore the edges of
//! a wire in a connection order.
//!
//! i.e. each edge is connected to the previous one by
//! its origin.
//! If a wire is not closed returns only a segment of edges which
//! length depends on started in exploration edge. 
//! Algorithm suggests that wire is valid and has no any defects, which 
//! can stop edge exploration. Such defects can be loops, wrong orientation of edges
//! (two edges go in to shared vertex or go out from shared vertex), branching of edges, 
//! the presens of edges with INTERNAL or EXTERNAL orientation. If wire has
//! such kind of defects WireExplorer can return not all
//! edges in a wire. it depends on type of defect and position of starting edge.
