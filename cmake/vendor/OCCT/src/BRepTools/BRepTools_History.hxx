DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(BRepTools_History, Standard_Transient)

//! The history keeps the following relations between the input shapes
//! (S1, ..., Sm) and output shapes (T1, ..., Tn):
//! 1) an output shape Tj is generated from an input shape Si: Tj <= G(Si);
//! 2) a output shape Tj is modified from an input shape Si: Tj <= M(Si);
//! 3) an input shape (Si) is removed: R(Si) == 1.
//!
//! The relations are kept only for shapes of types vertex, edge, face, and
//! solid.
//!
//! The last relation means that:
//! 1) shape Si is not an output shape and
//! 2) no any shape is modified (produced) from shape Si:
//! R(Si) == 1 ==> Si != Tj, M(Si) == 0.
//!
//! It means that the input shape cannot be removed and modified
//! simultaneously. However, the shapes may be generated from the
//! removed shape. For instance, in Fillet operation the edges
//! generate faces and then are removed.
//!
//! No any shape could be generated and modified from the same shape
//! simultaneously: sets G(Si) and M(Si) are not intersected
//! (G(Si) ^ M(Si) == 0).
//!
//! Each output shape should be:
//! 1) an input shape or
//! 2) generated or modified from an input shape (even generated from the
//!   implicit null shape if necessary):
//!   Tj == Si V (exists Si that Tj <= G(Si) U M(Si)).
//!
//! Recommendations to choose between relations 'generated' and 'modified':
//! 1) a shape is generated from input shapes if it dimension is greater or
//!   smaller than the dimensions of the input shapes;
//! 2) a shape is generated from input shapes if these shapes are also output
//!   shapes;
//! 3) a shape is generated from input shapes of the same dimension if it is
//!   produced by joining shapes generated from these shapes;
//! 4) a shape is modified from an input shape if it replaces the input shape by
//!   changes of the location, the tolerance, the bounds of the parametric
//!   space (the faces for a solid), the parametrization and/or by applying of
//!   an approximation;
//! 5) a shape is modified from input shapes of the same dimension if it is
//!   produced by joining shapes modified from these shapes.
//!
//! Two sequential histories:
//! - one history (H12) of shapes S1, ..., Sm to shapes T1, ..., Tn and
//! - another history (H23) of shapes T1, ..., Tn to shapes Q1, ..., Ql
//! could be merged to the single history (H13) of shapes S1, ..., Sm to shapes
//! Q1, ..., Ql.
//!
//! During the merge:
//! 1) if shape Tj is generated from shape Si then each shape generated or
//!   modified from shape Tj is considered as a shape generated from shape Si
//!   among shapes Q1, ..., Ql:
//!   Tj <= G12(Si), Qk <= G23(Tj) U M23(Tj) ==> Qk <= G13(Si).
//! 2) if shape Tj is modified from shape Si, shape Qk is generated from shape
//!   Tj then shape Qk is considered as a shape generated from shape Si among
//!   shapes Q1, ..., Ql:
//!   Tj <= M12(Si), Qk <= G23(Tj) ==> Qk <= G13(Si);
//! 3) if shape Tj is modified from shape Si, shape Qk is modified from shape
//!   Tj then shape Qk is considered as a shape modified from shape Si among
//!   shapes Q1, ..., Ql:
//!   Tj <= M12(Si), Qk <= M23(Tj) ==> Qk <= M13(Si);
