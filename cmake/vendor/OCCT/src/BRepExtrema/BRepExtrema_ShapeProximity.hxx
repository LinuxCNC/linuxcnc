//! @brief Tool class for shape proximity detection.
//!
//! First approach:
//! For two given shapes and given tolerance (offset from the mesh) the algorithm allows
//! to determine whether or not they are overlapped. The algorithm input consists of any
//! shapes which can be decomposed into individual faces (used as basic shape elements).
//!
//! The algorithm can be run in two modes. If tolerance is set to zero, the algorithm
//! will detect only intersecting faces (containing triangles with common points). If
//! tolerance is set to positive value, the algorithm will also detect faces located
//! on distance less than the given tolerance from each other.
//!
//! Second approach:
//! Compute the proximity value between two shapes if the tolerance is not defined (Precision::Infinite()).
//! In this case the proximity value is a minimal thickness of a layer containing both shapes.
//!
//! For the both approaches the high performance is achieved through the use of existing
//! triangulation of faces. So, poly triangulation (with the desired deflection) should already
//! be built. Note that solution is approximate (and corresponds to the deflection used for
//! triangulation).
