//! The abstract class AxisPlacement describes the
//! common behavior of positioning systems in 3D space,
//! such as axis or coordinate systems.
//! The Geom package provides two implementations of
//! 3D positioning systems:
//! - the axis (Geom_Axis1Placement class), which is defined by:
//! - its origin, also termed the "Location point" of the  axis,
//! - its unit vector, termed the "Direction" or "main
//! Direction" of the axis;
//! - the right-handed coordinate system
//! (Geom_Axis2Placement class), which is defined by:
//! - its origin, also termed the "Location point" of the coordinate system,
//! - three orthogonal unit vectors, termed
//! respectively the "X Direction", the "Y Direction"
//! and the "Direction" of the coordinate system. As
//! the coordinate system is right-handed, these
//! unit vectors have the following relation:
//! "Direction" = "X Direction" ^
//! "Y Direction". The "Direction" is also
//! called the "main Direction" because, when the
//! unit vector is modified, the "X Direction" and "Y
//! Direction" are recomputed, whereas when the "X
//! Direction" or "Y Direction" is modified, the "main Direction" does not change.
//! The axis whose origin is the origin of the positioning
//! system and whose unit vector is its "main Direction" is
//! also called the "Axis" or "main Axis" of the positioning system.

  //! Geom_Axis2Placement, then its "X Direction" and
  //! "Y Direction" are recomputed.
  //! Exceptions

  //! Standard_ConstructionError if A1 and the
