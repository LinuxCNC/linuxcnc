DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(Geom_BoundedSurface, Geom_Surface)

//! The root class for bounded surfaces in 3D space. A
//! bounded surface is defined by a rectangle in its 2D parametric space, i.e.
//! - its u parameter, which ranges between two finite
//! values u0 and u1, referred to as "First u
//! parameter" and "Last u parameter" respectively, and
//! - its v parameter, which ranges between two finite
//! values v0 and v1, referred to as "First v
//! parameter" and the "Last v parameter" respectively.
//! The surface is limited by four curves which are the
//! boundaries of the surface:
//! - its u0 and u1 isoparametric curves in the u parametric direction, and
//! - its v0 and v1 isoparametric curves in the v parametric direction.
//! A bounded surface is finite.
//! The common behavior of all bounded surfaces is
//! described by the Geom_Surface class.
//! The Geom package provides three concrete
//! implementations of bounded surfaces:
//! - Geom_BezierSurface,
//! - Geom_BSplineSurface, and
//! - Geom_RectangularTrimmedSurface.
//! The first two of these implement well known
//! mathematical definitions of complex surfaces, the third
//! trims a surface using four isoparametric curves, i.e. it
//! limits the variation of its parameters to a rectangle in
//! 2D parametric space.
