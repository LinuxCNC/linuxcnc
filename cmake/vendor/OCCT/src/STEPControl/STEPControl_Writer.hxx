  //! - 1 gives the number, identifier, type and result type for each
  //! STEP entity and/or its status (fail, warning, etc.),
  //! - 2 gives maximum information for each STEP entity (i.e. checks),
  //! - 3 gives the number of entities by the type of a STEP entity,
  //! - 4 gives the number of of STEP entities per result type and/or status,
  //! - 5 gives the number of pairs (STEP or result type and status),
  //! - 6 gives the number of pairs (STEP or result type and status)
  //! AND the list of entity numbers in the STEP model.
