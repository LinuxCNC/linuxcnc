//! Class for synchronization of transactions within multiple documents.
//! Each transaction of this class involvess one transaction in each modified document.
//!
//! The documents to be synchronized should be added explicitly to
//! the manager; then its interface is used to ensure that all transactions
//! (Open/Commit, Undo/Redo) are performed synchronously in all managed documents.
//!
//! The current implementation does not support nested transactions
//! on multitransaction manager level. It only sets the flag enabling
//! or disabling nested transactions in all its documents, so that
//! a nested transaction can be opened for each particular document
//! with TDocStd_Document class interface.
//!
//! NOTE: When you invoke CommitTransaction of multi transaction
//! manager, all nested transaction of its documents will be closed (committed).
