//! This class provides for a framework to construct a shell
//! or a solid along a spine consisting in a wire.
//! To produce a solid, the initial wire must be closed.
//! Two approaches are used:
//! - definition by section
//! - by a section and a scaling law
//! - by addition of successive intermediary sections
//! - definition by sweep mode.
//! - pseudo-Frenet
//! - constant
//! - binormal constant
//! - normal defined by a surface support
//! - normal defined by a guiding contour.
//! The two global approaches can also be combined.
//! You can also close the surface later in order to form a solid.
//! Warning: some limitations exist
//! -- Mode with auxiliary spine is incompatible with hometetic laws
//! -- Mode with auxiliary spine and keep contact produce only CO surface.
