//! N-Side Filling
//! This algorithm avoids to build a face from:
//! * a set of edges defining the bounds of the face and some
//! constraints the surface of the face has to satisfy
//! * a set of edges and points defining some constraints
//! the support surface has to satisfy
//! * an initial surface to deform for satisfying the constraints
//! * a set of parameters to control the constraints.
//!
//! The support surface of the face is computed by deformation
//! of the initial surface in order to satisfy the given constraints.
//! The set of bounding edges defines the wire of the face.
//!
//! If no initial surface is given, the algorithm computes it
//! automatically.
//! If the set of edges is not connected (Free constraint)
//! missing edges are automatically computed.
//!
//! Limitations:
//! * If some constraints are not compatible
//! The algorithm does not take them into account.
//! So the constraints will not be satisfyed in an area containing
//! the incompatibilitries.
//! * The constraints defining the bound of the face have to be
//! entered in order to have a continuous wire.
//!
//! Other Applications:
//! * Deformation of a face to satisfy internal constraints
//! * Deformation of a face to improve Gi continuity with
//! connected faces

  //! - the 3D tolerance Tol3d
  //! - the angular tolerance TolAng
  //! - the tolerance for curvature TolCur
  //! - the highest polynomial degree MaxDeg
  //! - the greatest number of segments MaxSeg.
  //! If the Boolean Anistropie is true, the algorithm's
