  //! 1 for label  (and corresponding numbers are displayed apart)

  //! - 0 : prints the TYPE only, as known in STEP Files (StepType)
  //! If <ent> has not been regognized by the Protocol, or if its
  //! type is Complex, the StepType is replaced by the display of
  //! the cdl type. Complex Type are well processed by level 1.
  //! - 1 : dumps the entity, completely (whatever it has simple or
  //! complex type) but alone.
  //! - 2 : dumps the entity completely, plus the item its refers to
  //! at first level (a header message designates the starting
  //! entity of the dump) <Lists Shared and Implied>
  //! - 3 : dumps the entity and its referred items at any levels
  //!
  //! For levels 1,2,3, the numbers displayed (form #nnn) are the
  //! numbers of the corresponding entities in the Model
