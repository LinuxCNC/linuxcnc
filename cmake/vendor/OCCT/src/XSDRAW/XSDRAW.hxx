//! Basic package to work functions of X-STEP (IFSelect & Co)

//!
//! Works with some "static" data : a SessionPilot (used to run)
//! with its WorkSession and Model and TransferReader, a
//! FinderProcess
class XSDRAW 
{
 public:

  //! Takes variables to/from the DRAW session
  //! Implements ProgressIndicator for DRAW
  //! Changes the name under which a command of xstep is known by
  //! Draw. This allows to avoid collisions
  //! To be called before LoadDraw or any other xstep initialisation
  Standard_EXPORT static void ChangeCommand (const Standard_CString oldname, const Standard_CString newname);
  
  //! Removes a command from the interpretation list of Draw
  //! To be called before LoadDraw or any other xstep initialisation
  Standard_EXPORT static void RemoveCommand (const Standard_CString oldname);
  
  //! Defines the basic context to work with a X-STEP Session :
  //! it performs the basic inits, also records the Controller
  //! If the Controller is not yet set, it must be set after
  //! (call to SetController)
  //! LoadSession is called by LoadDraw
  //! Returns True the first time, False if already called
  Standard_EXPORT static Standard_Boolean LoadSession();
  
  //! Defines the context for using a X-STEP Session under DRAW
  //! Once the various INITs have been done, a call to LoadDraw
  //! records the defined commands for the X-STEP SessionPilot,
  //! into the DRAW interpretation list.
  //! "Set" commands are accessed under command xset
  //! SDS>xset name command ...
  //! Other commands can be accessed directly or under command xstep
  //! SDS>command ...  and  SDS>xstep command ...  are equivalent
  //!
  //! Only the command xinit is accessed directly only :
  //! SDS>xinit  (from the already defined Controller)
  //! SDS>xinit iges  (first defines the Controller as for "iges")
  //!
  //! It also records the function to be called by DRAW (not
  //! declared because specific).
  //! And it defines the context variables, i.e. a WorkSession, then
  //! it calls SetController with the currently defined Controller
  //! Remark : at least, the standard commands are recorded
  //!
  //! See also Controller : it is part of the Context, but it must
  //! be precised separately
  Standard_EXPORT static void LoadDraw (Draw_Interpretor& theCommands);
  
  //! Allows to execute a xstep-draw command from C++ program

  //! Initialises a TransferReader, according to mode :
  //! 0 nullifies it,  1 clears it (not nullify)
  //! 2 sets it with TransientProcess & Model
  //! 3 idem plus roots of TransientProcess
  //! Remark : called with 0 at least at each SetModel/NewModel

  //! In the latter case, empty resfile means no file available
  //!
  //! If <file> is null or empty or equates ".", considers Session
