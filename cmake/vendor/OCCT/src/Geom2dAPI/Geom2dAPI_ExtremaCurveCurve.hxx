//! Describes functions for computing all the extrema
//! between two 2D curves.
//! An ExtremaCurveCurve algorithm minimizes or
//! maximizes the distance between a point on the first
//! curve and a point on the second curve. Thus, it
//! computes the start point and end point of
//! perpendiculars common to the two curves (an
//! intersection point is not an extremum except where
//! the two curves are tangential at this point).
//! Solutions consist of pairs of points, and an extremum
//! is considered to be a segment joining the two points of a solution.
//! An ExtremaCurveCurve object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the construction of the extrema,
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the results.
//! Warning
//! In some cases, the nearest points between two
//! curves do not correspond to one of the computed
//! extrema. Instead, they may be given by:
//! -   a limit point of one curve and one of the following:
//! -   its orthogonal projection on the other curve,
//! -   a limit point of the other curve; or
//! -   an intersection point between the two curves.
