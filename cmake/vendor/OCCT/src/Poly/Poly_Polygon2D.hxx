//! Provides a polygon in 2D space (for example, in the
//! parametric space of a surface). It is generally an
//! approximate representation of a curve.
//! A Polygon2D is defined by a table of nodes. Each node is
//! a 2D point. If the polygon is closed, the point of closure is
//! repeated at the end of the table of nodes.

  //! Returns the deflection of this polygon.
  //! Deflection is used in cases where the polygon is an
  //! approximate representation of a curve. Deflection
  //! represents the maximum distance permitted between any
  //! point on the curve and the corresponding point on the polygon.
  //! By default the deflection value is equal to 0. An algorithm
  //! using this 2D polygon with a deflection value equal to 0
  //! considers that it is working with a true polygon and not with
  //! an approximate representation of a curve. The Deflection
  //! function is used to modify the deflection value of this polygon.
  //! The deflection value can be used by any algorithm working  with 2D polygons.
  //! For example:
  //! -   An algorithm may use a unique deflection value for all
  //! its polygons. In this case it is not necessary to use the
  //! Deflection function.
  //! -   Or an algorithm may want to attach a different
  //! deflection to each polygon. In this case, the Deflection
  //! function is used to set a value on each polygon, and
  //! later to fetch the value.
