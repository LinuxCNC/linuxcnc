//! A framework for filtering the computation
//! results of an HLRBRep_Algo algorithm by extraction.
//! From the results calculated by the algorithm on
//! a shape, a filter returns the type of edge you
//! want to identify. You can choose any of the following types of output:
//! -   visible sharp edges
//! -   hidden sharp edges
//! -   visible smooth edges
//! -   hidden smooth edges
//! -   visible sewn edges
//! -   hidden sewn edges
//! -   visible outline edges
//! -   hidden outline edges.
//! -   visible isoparameters and
//! -   hidden isoparameters.
//! Sharp edges present a C0 continuity (non G1).
//! Smooth edges present a G1 continuity (non G2).
//! Sewn edges present a C2 continuity.
//! The result is composed of 2D edges in the
//! projection plane of the view which the
//! algorithm has worked with. These 2D edges
//! are not included in the data structure of the visualized shape.
//! In order to obtain a complete image, you must
//! combine the shapes given by each of the chosen filters.
//! The construction of the shape does not call a
//! new computation of the algorithm, but only
//! reads its internal results.
