DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(Geom2d_BezierCurve, Geom2d_BoundedCurve)

//! Describes a rational or non-rational Bezier curve
//! - a non-rational Bezier curve is defined by a table
//! of poles (also called control points),
//! - a rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of
//! poles with varying weights.
//! These data are manipulated by two parallel arrays:
//! - the poles table, which is an array of gp_Pnt2d points, and
//! - the weights table, which is an array of reals.
//! The bounds of these arrays are 1 and "the number of poles" of the curve.
//! The poles of the curve are "control points" used to deform the curve.
//! The first pole is the start point of the curve, and the
//! last pole is the end point of the curve. The segment
//! which joins the first pole to the second pole is the
//! tangent to the curve at its start point, and the
//! segment which joins the last pole to the
//! second-from-last pole is the tangent to the curve
//! at its end point.
//! It is more difficult to give a geometric signification
//! to the weights but they are useful for providing
//! exact representations of the arcs of a circle or
//! ellipse. Moreover, if the weights of all the poles are
//! equal, the curve is polynomial; it is therefore a
//! non-rational curve. The non-rational curve is a
//! special and frequently used case. The weights are
//! defined and used only in case of a rational curve.
//! The degree of a Bezier curve is equal to the
//! number of poles, minus 1. It must be greater than or
//! equal to 1. However, the degree of a
//! Geom2d_BezierCurve curve is limited to a value
//! (25) which is defined and controlled by the system.
//! This value is returned by the function MaxDegree.
//! The parameter range for a Bezier curve is [ 0, 1 ].
//! If the first and last control points of the Bezier
//! curve are the same point then the curve is closed.
//! For example, to create a closed Bezier curve with
//! four control points, you have to give a set of control
//! points P1, P2, P3 and P1.
//! The continuity of a Bezier curve is infinite.
//! It is not possible to build a Bezier curve with
//! negative weights. We consider that a weight value
//! is zero if it is less than or equal to
//! gp::Resolution(). We also consider that
//! two weight values W1 and W2 are equal if:
//! |W2 - W1| <= gp::Resolution().
//! Warning
//! - When considering the continuity of a closed
//! Bezier curve at the junction point, remember that
//! a curve of this type is never periodic. This means
//! that the derivatives for the parameter u = 0
//! have no reason to be the same as the
//! derivatives for the parameter u = 1 even if the curve is closed.
//! - The length of a Bezier curve can be null.
