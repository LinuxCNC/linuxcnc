DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(Geom2d_OffsetCurve, Geom2d_Curve)


//! This class implements the basis services for the creation,
//! edition, modification and evaluation of planar offset curve.
//! The offset curve is obtained by offsetting by distance along
//! the normal to a basis curve defined in 2D space.
//! The offset curve in this package can be a self intersecting
//! curve even if the basis curve does not self-intersect.
//! The self intersecting portions are not deleted at the
//! construction time.
//! An offset curve is a curve at constant distance (Offset) from a
//! basis curve and the offset curve takes its parametrization from
//! the basis curve. The Offset curve is in the direction of the
//! normal to the basis curve N.
//! The distance offset may be positive or negative to indicate the
//! preferred side of the curve :
//! . distance offset >0 => the curve is in the direction of N
//! . distance offset >0 => the curve is in the direction of - N
//! On the Offset curve :
//! Value(u) = BasisCurve.Value(U) + (Offset * (T ^ Z)) / ||T ^ Z||
//! where T is the tangent vector to the basis curve and Z the
//! direction of the normal vector to the plane of the curve,
//! N = T ^ Z defines the offset direction and should not have
//! null length.
//!
//! Warnings :
//! In this package we suppose that the continuity of the offset
//! curve is one degree less than the continuity of the
//! basis curve and we don't check that at any point ||T^Z|| != 0.0
//!
//! So to evaluate the curve it is better to check that the offset
//! curve is well defined at any point because an exception could
//! be raised. The check is not done in this package at the creation
//! of the offset curve because the control needs the use of an
//! algorithm which cannot be implemented in this package.
//! The OffsetCurve is closed if the first point and the last point
//! are the same (The distance between these two points is lower or
//! equal to the Resolution sea package gp) . The OffsetCurve can be
//! closed even if the basis curve is not closed.

  //! curve and the basis curve at any point.
  //! A point on the offset curve is built by measuring the

  //! This normal vector is obtained by rotating the
  //! vector tangential to C at 90 degrees in the
  //! anti-trigonometric sense. The side of C on which
  //! the offset value is measured is indicated by this
