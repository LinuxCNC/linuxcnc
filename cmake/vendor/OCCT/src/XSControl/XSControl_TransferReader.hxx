//! A TransferReader performs, manages, handles results of,
//! transfers done when reading a file (i.e. from entities of an
//! InterfaceModel, to objects for Imagine)
//!
//! Running is organised around basic tools : TransientProcess and
//! its Actor, results are Binders and CheckIterators. It implies
//! control by a Controller (which prepares the Actor as required)
//!
//! Getting results can be done directly on TransientProcess, but
//! these are immediate "last produced" results. Each transfer of
//! an entity gives a final result, but also possible intermediate
//! data, and checks, which can be attached to sub-entities.
//!
//! Hence, final results (which intermediates and checks) are
//! recorded as ResultFromModel and can be queried individually.
//!
//! Some more direct access are given for results which are
//! Transient or Shapes
