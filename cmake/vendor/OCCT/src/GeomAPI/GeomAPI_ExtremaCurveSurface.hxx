//! Describes functions for computing all the extrema
//! between a curve and a surface.
//! An ExtremaCurveSurface algorithm minimizes or
//! maximizes the distance between a point on the curve
//! and a point on the surface. Thus, it computes start
//! and end points of perpendiculars common to the
//! curve and the surface (an intersection point is not an
//! extremum except where the curve and the surface
//! are tangential at this point).
//! Solutions consist of pairs of points, and an extremum
//! is considered to be a segment joining the two points of a solution.
//! An ExtremaCurveSurface object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the construction of the extrema,
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the results.
//! Warning
//! In some cases, the nearest points between a curve
//! and a surface do not correspond to one of the
//! computed extrema. Instead, they may be given by:
//! -   a point of a bounding curve of the surface and one of the following:
//! -   its orthogonal projection on the curve,
//! -   a limit point of the curve; or
//! -   a limit point of the curve and its projection on the surface; or
//! -   an intersection point between the curve and the surface.
