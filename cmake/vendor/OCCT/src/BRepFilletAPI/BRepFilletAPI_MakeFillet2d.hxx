//! Fillets and Chamfers on the Vertices of a Planar Face
//! A MakeFillet2d object provides a framework for:
//! - initializing the construction algorithm with a given face,
//! - acquiring the data characterizing the fillets and chamfers,
//! -   building the fillets and chamfers, and constructing the
//! resulting shape, and
//! -   consulting the result.
//! Warning
//! Only segments of straight lines and arcs of circles are
