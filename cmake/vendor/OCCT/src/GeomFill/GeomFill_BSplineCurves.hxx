//! An algorithm for constructing a BSpline surface filled
//! from contiguous BSpline curves which form its boundaries.
//! The algorithm accepts two, three or four BSpline
//! curves as the boundaries of the target surface.
//! A range of filling styles - more or less rounded, more
//! or less flat - is available.
//! A BSplineCurves object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the boundaries, and the filling style of the surface
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm
//! -   consulting the result.
//! Warning
//! Some problems may show up with rational curves.
