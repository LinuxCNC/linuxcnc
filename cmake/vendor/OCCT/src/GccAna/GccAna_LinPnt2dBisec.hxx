//! Describes functions for building bisecting curves between a 2D line and a point.
//! A bisecting curve between a line and a point is such a
//! curve that each of its points is at the same distance from
//! the circle and the point. It can be a parabola or a line,
//! depending on the relative position of the line and the
//! circle. There is always one unique solution.
//! A LinPnt2dBisec object provides a framework for:
//! - defining the construction of the bisecting curve,
//! - implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! - consulting the result.
