//! This class implements the algorithms used to

//! Describes functions for building a bisecting line between two 2D points.
//! The bisecting line between two points is the bisector of
//! the segment which joins the two points, if these are not coincident.
//! The algorithm does not find a solution if the two points are coincident.
//! A Pnt2dBisec object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the construction of the bisecting line,
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and consulting the result.
