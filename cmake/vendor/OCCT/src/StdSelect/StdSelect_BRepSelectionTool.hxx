//! Tool to create specific selections (sets of primitives)
//! for Shapes from Topology.
//! These Selections may be used  in dynamic selection
//! Mechanism
//! Given a Shape and a mode of selection
//! (selection of vertices,
//! edges,faces ...) , This Tool Computes corresponding sensitive primitives,
//! puts them in an entity called Selection (see package SelectMgr) and returns it.
//!
//! A Priority for the decomposed pickable objects can be given ;
//! by default There is A Preset Hierarchy:
//! Vertex             priority : 5
//! Edge               priority : 4
//! Wire               priority : 3
//! Face               priority : 2
//! Shell,solid,shape  priority : 1
//! the default priority in the following methods has no sense - it's only taken in account
//! when the user gives a value between 0 and 10.
//! IMPORTANT : This decomposition creates BRepEntityOwner instances (from StdSelect).
//! which are stored in the Sensitive Entities coming from The Decomposition.
//!
//! the result of picking in a ViewerSelector return EntityOwner from SelectMgr;
//! to know what kind of object was picked :
//!
//! ENTITY_OWNER -> Selectable() gives the selectableobject which
//! was decomposed into pickable elements.
//! Handle(StdSelect_BRepOwner)::DownCast(ENTITY_OWNER) -> Shape()
//! gives the real picked shape (edge,vertex,shape...)

  //! the sensitive entities.
  //! maximal parameter is used for infinite objects, to limit the sensitive Domain....
