//! A ReportEntity is produced to aknowledge and memorize the
//! binding between a Check and an Entity. The Check can bring
//! Fails (+ Warnings if any), or only Warnings. If it is empty,
//! the Report Entity is for an Unknown Entity.
//!
//! The ReportEntity brings : the Concerned Entity, the
//! Check, and if the Entity is empty (Fails due to Read
//! Errors, hence the Entity could not be loaded), a Content.
//! The Content is itself an Transient Object, but remains in a
//! literal form : it is an "Unknown Entity". If the Concerned
//! Entity is itself Unknown, Concerned and Content are equal.
//!
//! According to the Check, if it brings Fail messages,
//! the ReportEntity is an "Error Entity", the Concerned Entity is
//! an "Erroneous Entity". Else it is a "Correction Entity", the
//! Concerned Entity is a "Corrected Entity". With no Check
//! message and if Concerned and Content are equal, it reports
//! for an "Unknown Entity".
//!
//! Each norm must produce its own type of Unknown Entity, but can
//! use the class UndefinedContent to brings parameters : it is
//! enough for most of information and avoids to redefine them,
//! only the specific part remains to be defined for each norm.
