//! Defines services which are required to load an InterfaceModel
//! from a File. Typically, it may firstly transform a system
//! file into a FileReaderData object, then work on it, not longer
//! considering file contents, to load an Interface Model.
//! It may also work on a FileReaderData already loaded.
//!
//! FileReaderTool provides, on one hand, some general services
//! which are common to all read operations but can be redefined,
//! plus general actions to be performed specifically for each
//! Norm, as deferred methods to define.
//!
//! In particular, FileReaderTool defines the Interface's Unknown
//! and Error entities
