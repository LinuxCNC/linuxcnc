//! filters. These only allow dynamic detection and
//! selection of objects which correspond to the criteria defined in each.
//! Eight standard filters inheriting SelectMgr_Filter are
//! defined in Open CASCADE.
//! You can create your own filters by defining new filter
//! classes inheriting this framework. You use these
//! filters by loading them into an AIS interactive context.

  //! direct or user. A direct owner is the corresponding
  //! construction element, whereas a user is the
  //! compound shape of which the entity forms a part.
  //! When an object is detected by the mouse - in AIS,
  //! this is done through a context selector - its owner
  //! is passed to the filter as an argument.
  //! If the object returns Standard_True, it is kept; if
  //! not, it is rejected.
  //! If you are creating a filter class inheriting this
  //! framework, and the daughter class is to be used in
