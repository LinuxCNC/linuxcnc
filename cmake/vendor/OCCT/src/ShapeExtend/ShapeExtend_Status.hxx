#ifndef _ShapeExtend_Status_HeaderFile
#define _ShapeExtend_Status_HeaderFile

//! This enumeration is used in
//! ShapeHealing toolkit for representing flags in the
//! return statuses of class methods.
//! The status is a field of the class which is set by one or
//! several methods of that class.
//! It is used for reporting about errors and other situations
//! encountered during execution of the method.
//! There are defined 8 values for DONE and 8 for FAIL flags:
//! ShapeExtend_DONE1 ...      ShapeExtend_DONE8,
//! ShapeExtend_FAIL1 ...      ShapeExtend_FAIL8
//! and also enumerations for representing combinations of flags:
//! ShapeExtend_OK - no flags at all,
//! ShapeExtend_DONE - any of flags DONEi,
//! ShapeExtend_FAIL - any of flags FAILi.
//! The class that uses statuses provides a method(s) which
//! answers whether the flag corresponding to a given
//! enumerative value is (are) set:
//! Standard_Boolean Status(const ShapeExtend_Status test);
//! Note that status can have several flags set simultaneously.
//! Status(ShapeExtend_OK) gives True when no flags are set.
//! Nothing done, everything OK
//! Something was done, case 1
//! Something was done, case 2
//! Something was done, case 3
//! Something was done, case 4
//! Something was done, case 5
//! Something was done, case 6
//! Something was done, case 7
//! Something was done, case 8
//! Something was done (any of DONE#)
//! The method failed, case 1
//! The method failed, case 2
//! The method failed, case 3
//! The method failed, case 4
//! The method failed, case 5
//! The method failed, case 6
//! The method failed, case 7
//! The method failed, case 8
//! The method failed (any of FAIL# occurred)
