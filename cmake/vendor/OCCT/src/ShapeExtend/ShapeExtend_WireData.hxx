//! This class provides a data structure necessary for work with the wire as with
//! ordered list of edges, what is required for many algorithms. The advantage of
//! this class is that it allows to work with wires which are not correct.
//! The object of the class ShapeExtend_WireData can be initialized by
//! TopoDS_Wire, and converted back to TopoDS_Wire.
//! An edge in the wire is defined by its rank number. Operations of accessing,
//! adding and removing edge at the given rank number are provided. On the whole
//! wire, operations of circular permutation and reversing (both orientations of
//! all edges and order of edges) are provided as well.
//! This class also provides a method to check if the edge in the wire is a seam
//! (if the wire lies on a face).
//! This class is handled by reference. Such an approach gives the following advantages:
//! 1.    Sharing the object of this class strongly optimizes the processes of
//! analysis and fixing performed in parallel on the wire stored in the form
//! of this class. Fixing tool (e.g. ShapeFix_Wire) fixes problems one by
//! one using analyzing tool (e.g. ShapeAnalysis_Wire). Sharing allows not
//! to reinitialize each time the analyzing tool with modified
//! ShapeExtend_WireData what consumes certain time.
//! 2.    No copying of contents. The object of ShapeExtend_WireData class has
//! quite big size, returning it as a result of the function would cause
//! additional copying of contents if this class were one handled by value.
//! Moreover, this class is stored as a field in other classes which are
//! they returned as results of functions, storing only a handle to
//! ShapeExtend_WireData saves time and memory.
