//! This  package  defines   standard attributes for
//! modelling.
//! These allow you to create and modify labels
//! and attributes for many basic data types.
//! Standard topological and visualization
//! attributes have also been created.
//! To find an attribute attached to a specific label,
//! you use the GUID of the type of attribute you
//! are looking for. To do this, first find this
//! information using the method GetID as follows: Standard_GUID anID =
//! MyAttributeClass::GetID();
//! Then, use the method Find for the label as follows:
//! Standard_Boolean HasAttribute
//! =
//! aLabel.Find(anID,anAttribute);
//! Note
//! For information on the relations between this
//! component of OCAF and the others, refer to the OCAF User's Guide.
