  //! computed.
  //! Returns Standard_True if Index is positive, Points' and Weights'

  //! Returns a vector of Kronrod points and a vector of their

  //! Index should be odd and greater then or equal to 3,
  //! as the number of Kronrod points is equal to 2*N + 1,
  //! where N is a number of Gauss points. Points and Weights should
  //! have the size equal to Index. Each even element of Points
  //! represents a Gauss point value of N-th Gauss quadrature.
  //! The values from Index equal to 3 to 123 are stored in a
  //! table (see the file math_Kronrod.cxx). If Index is greater,
  //! then points and weights will be computed. Returns Standard_True
  //! if Index is odd, it is equal to the size of Points and Weights
  //! and the computation of Points and Weights is performed successfully.
  //! Otherwise this method returns Standard_False.
