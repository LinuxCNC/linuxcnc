//! This class manages Statistics to be queried asynchronously.
//!
//! It is organized as a stack of counters, identified by their
//! levels, from one to ... . Each one has a total account of
//! items to be counted, a count of already passed items, plus a
//! count of "current items". The counters of higher level play on
//! these current items.
//! For instance, if a counter has been opened for 100 items, 40
//! already passed, 20 current, its own percent is 40, but there
//! is the contribution of higher level counters, rated for 20 %
//! of this counter.
//!
//! Hence, a counter is opened, items are added. Also items can be
//! add for sub-counter (of higher level), they will be added
//! definitively when the sub-counter will be closed. When the
//! count has ended, this counter is closed, the counter of
//! lower level cumulates it and goes on. As follows :
//!
//! Way of use :
//! Open(nbitems);
//! Add(..)  :  direct adding
//! Add(..)
//! AddSub (nsub)  :  for sub-counter
//! Open (nbsubs)  :  nbsubs for this sub-counter
//! Add (..)
//! Close        : the sub-counter
//! AddEnd()
//! etc...
//! Close          : the starting counter
//!
//! This means that a counter can be opened in a Stat, regardless
//! to the already opened ones :: this will be cumulated
//!
//! A Current Stat is available, but it is possible to have others
