//! A  Builder is used   to  create  Topological  Data
//! Structures.It is the root of the Builder class hierarchy.
//!
//! There are three groups of methods in the Builder :
//!
//! The Make methods create Shapes.
//!
//! The Add method includes a Shape in another Shape.
//!
//! The Remove  method  removes a  Shape from an other
//! Shape.
//!
//! The methods in Builder are not static. They can be
//! redefined in inherited builders.
//!
//! This   Builder does not  provide   methods to Make
//! Vertices,  Edges, Faces,  Shells  or Solids. These
//! methods are  provided  in  the inherited  Builders
//! as they must provide the geometry.
//!
//! The Add method check for the following rules :
//!
//! - Any SHAPE can be added in a COMPOUND.
//!
//! - Only SOLID can be added in a COMPSOLID.
//!
//! - Only SHELL, EDGE and VERTEX can be added in a SOLID.
//! EDGE and VERTEX as to be INTERNAL or EXTERNAL.
//!
//! - Only FACE can be added in a SHELL.
//!
//! - Only WIRE and VERTEX can be added in a FACE.
//! VERTEX as to be INTERNAL or EXTERNAL.
//!
//! - Only EDGE can be added in a WIRE.
//!
//! - Only VERTEX can be added in an EDGE.
//!
//! - Nothing can be added in a VERTEX.
