  //! The DlOpen method provides an interface to the
  //! dynamic library loader to allow shared libraries
  //! to be loaded and called at runtime.  The DlOpen
  //! function attempts to load Filename, in the address
  //! space of the process, resolving symbols as appropriate.
  //! Any libraries that Filename depends upon are also loaded.
  //! If MODE is RTLD_LAZY, then the runtime loader
  //! does symbol resolution only as needed.
  //! Typically, this means that the first call to a function
  //! in the newly	loaded library will cause the resolution of
  //! the	address	of that	function to occur.
  //! If Mode is RTLD_NOW, then the runtime loader must do all
  //! symbol binding during the DlOpen call.
  //! The DlOpen method returns a	handle that is used by DlSym
  //! or DlClose.
  //! If there is an error, Standard_False is returned,
  //! Standard_True otherwise.
  //! If a NULL Filename is specified, DlOpen returns a handle
  //! for the main	executable, which allows access to dynamic
  //! symbols in the running program.

  //! The dlsym function returns the address of the

  //! returned.

  //! that has been since been deallocated by DlClose,
  //! the results are undefined.
