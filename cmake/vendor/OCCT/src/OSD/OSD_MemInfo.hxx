//! This class provide information about memory utilized by current process.
//! This information includes:
//!  - Private Memory - synthetic value that tries to filter out the memory
//!                     usage only by the process itself (allocated for data
//!                     and stack), excluding dynamic libraries.
//!                     These pages may be in RAM or in SWAP.
//!  - Virtual Memory - amount of reserved and committed memory in the
//!                     user-mode portion of the virtual address space.
//!                     Notice that this counter includes reserved memory
//!                     (not yet in used) and shared between processes memory (libraries).
//!  - Working Set    - set of memory pages in the virtual address space of the process
//!                     that are currently resident in physical memory (RAM).
//!                     These pages are available for an application to use
//!                     without triggering a page fault.
//!  - Pagefile Usage - space allocated for the pagefile, in bytes.
//!                     Those pages may or may not be in memory (RAM)
//!                     thus this counter couldn't be used to estimate
//!                     how many active pages doesn't present in RAM.
//!
//! Notice that none of these counters can be used as absolute measure of
//! application memory consumption!
//!
//! User should analyze all values in specific case to make correct decision
//! about memory (over)usage. This is also prefferred to use specialized
//! tools to detect memory leaks.
//!
//! This also means that these values should not be used for intellectual
//! memory management by application itself.
