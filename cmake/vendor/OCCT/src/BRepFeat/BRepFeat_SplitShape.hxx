//! One of the most significant aspects of BRepFeat functionality is the use of local
//! operations as opposed to global ones. In a global operation, you would first construct a
//! form of the type you wanted in your final feature, and then remove matter so that it could
//! fit into your initial basis object. In a local operation, however, you specify the domain of
//! the feature construction with aspects of the shape on which the feature is being created.
//! These semantics are expressed in terms of a member shape of the basis shape from which -
//! or up to which - matter will be added or removed. As a result, local operations make
//! calculations simpler and faster than global operations.
//! In BRepFeat, the semantics of local operations define features constructed from a contour or a
//! part of the basis shape referred to as the tool. In a SplitShape object, wires or edges of a
//! face in the basis shape to be used as a part of the feature are cut out and projected to a plane
//! outside or inside the basis shape. By rebuilding the initial shape incorporating the edges and
//! the faces of the tool, protrusion or depression features can be constructed.
