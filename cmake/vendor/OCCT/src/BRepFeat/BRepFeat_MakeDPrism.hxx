//! Describes functions to build draft
//! prism topologies from basis shape surfaces. These can be depressions or protrusions.
//! The semantics of draft prism feature creation is based on the
//! construction of shapes:
//! -          along a length
//! -          up to a limiting face
//! -          from a limiting face to a height.
//! The shape defining construction of the draft prism feature can be
//! either the supporting edge or the concerned area of a face.
//! In case of the supporting edge, this contour can be attached to a
//! face of the basis shape by binding. When the contour is bound to this
//! face, the information that the contour will slide on the face
//! becomes available to the relevant class methods.
//! In case of the concerned area of a face, you could, for example, cut
//! it out and move it to a different height which will define the
//! limiting face of a protrusion or depression.
