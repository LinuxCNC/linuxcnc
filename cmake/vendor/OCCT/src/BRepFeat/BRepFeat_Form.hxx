//! Provides general functions to build form features.
//! Form features can be depressions or protrusions and include the following types:
//! -          Cylinder
//! -          Draft Prism
//! -          Prism
//! -          Revolved feature
//! -          Pipe
//! In each case, you have a choice of operation type between the following:
//! -          removing matter (a Boolean cut: Fuse setting 0)
//! -          adding matter (Boolean fusion: Fuse setting 1)
//! The semantics of form feature creation is based on the construction of shapes:
//! -      along a length
//! -      up to a limiting face
//! -      from a limiting face to a  height
//! -      above and/or below a plane
//! The shape defining construction of the feature can be either the
//! supporting edge or the concerned area of a face.
//! In case of the supporting edge, this contour can be attached to a
//! face of the basis shape by binding. When the contour is bound to this
//! face, the information that the contour will slide on the face
//! becomes available to the relevant class methods. In case of the
//! concerned area of a face, you could, for example, cut it out and
//! move it to a different height which will define the limiting face of a
//! protrusion or depression.
//! Topological definition with local operations of this sort makes
//! calculations simpler and faster than a global operation. The latter
//! would entail a second phase of removing unwanted matter to get the same result.
