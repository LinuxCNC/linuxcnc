//! BRepFeat is necessary for the
//! creation and manipulation of both form and mechanical features in a
//! Boundary Representation framework. Form features can be depressions or
//! protrusions and include the following types:
//! -          Cylinder
//! -          Draft Prism
//! -          Prism
//! -          Revolved feature
//! -          Pipe
//! Depending on whether you wish to make a depression or a protrusion,
//! you can choose your operation type between the following:
//! - removing matter (a Boolean cut: Fuse setting 0)
//! - adding matter (Boolean fusion: Fuse setting 1)
//! The semantics of form feature creation is based on the
//! construction of shapes:
//! -          for a certain length in a certain direction
//! -          up to a limiting face
//! -          from a limiting face at a height
//! -          above and/or below a plane
//! The shape defining the construction of a feature can be either a
//! supporting edge or a concerned area of a face.
//! In case of supporting edge, this contour can be attached to a face
//! of the basis shape by binding. When the contour is bound to this face,
//! the information that the contour will slide on the face becomes
//! available to the relevant class methods. In case of the concerned
//! area of a face, you could, for example, cut it out and move it at
//! a different height, which will define the limiting face of a
//! protrusion or depression. Topological definition with local
//! operations of this sort makes calculations simpler and faster
//! than a global operation. The latter would entail a second phase of
//! removing unwanted matter to get the same result.
//! Mechanical features include ribs - protrusions - and grooves (or
//! slots) - depressions along planar (linear) surfaces or revolution surfaces.
//! The semantics of mechanical features is based on giving
//! thickness to a contour. This thickness can either be unilateral
//! - on one side of the contour - or bilateral - on both sides. As in
//! the semantics of form features, the thickness is defined by
//! construction of shapes in specific contexts.
//! However, in case of mechanical features, development contexts
//! differ. Here they include extrusion:
//! -          to a limiting face of the basis shape
//! -          to or from a limiting plane
//! -          to a height.
