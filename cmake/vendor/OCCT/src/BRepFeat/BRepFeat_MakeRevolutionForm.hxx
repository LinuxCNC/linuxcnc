//! MakeRevolutionForm Generates a surface of
//! revolution in the feature as it slides along a
//! revolved face in the basis shape.
//! The semantics of mechanical features is built
//! around giving thickness to a contour. This
//! thickness can either be unilateral - on one side
//! of the contour - or bilateral - on both sides. As
//! in the semantics of form features, the thickness
//! is defined by construction of shapes in specific contexts.
//! The development contexts differ, however,in
//! case of mechanical features. Here they include extrusion:
//! -   to a limiting face of the basis shape
//! -   to or from a limiting plane
//! -   to a height.
