//! Provides methods to build faces.
//!
//! A face may be built :
//!
//! * From a surface.
//!
//! - Elementary surface from gp.
//!
//! - Surface from Geom.
//!
//! * From a surface and U,V values.
//!
//! * From a wire.
//!
//! - Find the surface automatically if possible.
//!
//! * From a surface and a wire.
//!
//! - A flag Inside is given, when this flag is True
//! the  wire is  oriented to bound a finite area on
//! the surface.
//!
//! * From a face and a wire.
//!
//! - The new wire is a perforation.

  //! Adds the wire <W> in the face <F>
  //! A general method to create a face is to give
  //! -      a surface S as the support (the geometric domain) of the face,
  //! -      and a wire W to bound it.
  //! The bounds of the face can also be defined by four parameter values
  //! umin, umax, vmin, vmax which determine isoparametric limitations on
  //! the parametric space of the surface. In this way, a patch is
  //! defined. The parameter values are optional. If they are omitted, the
  //! natural bounds of the surface are used. A wire is automatically
  //! built using the defined bounds. Up to four edges and four vertices
  //! are created with this wire (no edge is created when the
  //! corresponding parameter value is infinite).
  //! Wires can then be added using the function Add to define other
  //! restrictions on the face. These restrictions represent holes. More
  //! than one wire may be added by this way, provided that the wires do
  //! not cross each other and that they define only one area on the
  //! surface. (Be careful, however, as this is not checked).
  //! Forbidden addition of wires
  //! Note that in this schema, the third case is valid if edges of the
  //! wire W are declared internal to the face. As a result, these edges
  //! are no longer bounds of the face.
  //! A default tolerance (Precision::Confusion()) is given to the face,
  //! this tolerance may be increased during construction of the face
  //! using various algorithms.
  //! Rules applied to the arguments
  //! For the surface:
  //! -      The surface must not be a 'null handle'.
  //! -      If the surface is a trimmed surface, the basis surface is used.
  //! -      For the wire: the wire is composed of connected edges, each
  //! edge having a parametric curve description in the parametric
  //! domain of the surface; in other words, as a pcurve.
  //! For the parameters:
  //! -      The parameter values must be in the parametric range of the
  //! surface (or the basis surface, if the surface is trimmed). If this
  //! condition is not satisfied, the face is not built, and the Error
  //! function will return BRepBuilderAPI_ParametersOutOfRange.
  //! -      The bounding parameters p1 and p2 are adjusted on a periodic
  //! surface in a given parametric direction by adding or subtracting
  //! the period to obtain p1 in the parametric range of the surface and
  //! such p2, that p2 - p1 <= Period, where Period is the period of the
  //! surface in this parametric direction.
  //! -      A parameter value may be infinite. There will be no edge and
  //! no vertex in the corresponding direction.

  //! when real bounds are known. These will be added to
