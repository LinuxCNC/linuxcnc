//! This algorithm converts a B-spline surface into several

//! A BSplineSurfaceToBezierSurface object provides a framework for:

//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the results.

  //! The result consists of a grid of BasisSurface patches
  //! limited by isoparametric curves corresponding to knot
  //! values, both in the u and v parametric directions of
  //! the surface. A row in the grid corresponds to a series
  //! of adjacent patches, all limited by the same two
  //! u-isoparametric curves. A column in the grid
  //! corresponds to a series of adjacent patches, all
  //! limited by the same two v-isoparametric curves.
  //! Use the available interrogation functions to ascertain
  //! the number of computed Bezier patches, and then to
  //! construct each individual Bezier surface (or all Bezier surfaces).
  //! Note: ParametricTolerance is not used.
