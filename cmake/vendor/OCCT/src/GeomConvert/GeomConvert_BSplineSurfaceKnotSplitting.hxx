//! An algorithm to determine isoparametric curves along
//! which a BSpline surface should be split in order to
//! obtain patches of the same continuity. The continuity order is given at the
//! construction time. It is possible to compute the surface patches
//! corresponding to the splitting with the method of package
//! SplitBSplineSurface.
//! For a B-spline surface the discontinuities are localised at
//! the knot values. Between two knots values the B-spline is
//! infinitely continuously differentiable.  For each parametric
//! direction at a knot of range index the continuity in this
//! direction is equal to :  Degree - Mult (Index)   where  Degree
//! is the degree of the basis B-spline functions and Mult the
//! multiplicity of the knot of range Index in the given direction.
//! If for your computation you need to have B-spline surface with a
//! minima of continuity it can be interesting to know between which
//! knot values, a B-spline patch, has a continuity of given order.
//! This algorithm computes the indexes of the knots where you should
//! split the surface, to obtain patches with a constant continuity
//! given at the construction time. If you just want to compute the
//! local derivatives on the surface you don't need to create the
//! BSpline patches, you can use the functions LocalD1, LocalD2,
//! LocalD3, LocalDN of the class BSplineSurface from package Geom.
