//! An algorithm to determine points at which a BSpline
//! curve should be split in order to obtain arcs of the same continuity.
//! If you require curves with a minimum continuity for
//! your computation, it is useful to know the points
//! between which an arc has a continuity of a given
//! order. The continuity order is given at the construction time.
//! For a BSpline curve, the discontinuities are
//! localized at the knot values. Between two knot values
//! the BSpline is infinitely and continuously
//! differentiable. At a given knot, the continuity is equal
//! to: Degree - Mult, where Degree is the
//! degree of the BSpline curve and Mult is the multiplicity of the knot.
//! It is possible to compute the arcs which correspond to
//! this splitting using the global function
//! SplitBSplineCurve provided by the package GeomConvert.
//! A BSplineCurveKnotSplitting object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the curve to be analyzed and the
//! required degree of continuity,
//! -   implementing the computation algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the results.
