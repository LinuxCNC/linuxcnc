//! The RemoveFeatures algorithm is intended for reconstruction of
//! the shape by removal of the unwanted parts from it. These parts can
//! be holes, protrusions, spikes, fillets etc.
//! The shape itself is not modified, the new shape is built in
//! the result.
//!
//! Currently, only the shapes of type SOLID, COMPSOLID, and
//! COMPOUND of Solids are supported. And only the FACEs can be
//! removed from the shape.
//!
//! On the input the algorithm accepts the shape itself and the
//! faces which have to be removed. It does not matter how the faces
//! are given. It could be the separate faces or the collections of faces.
//! The faces should belong to the initial shape, and those that
//! do not belong will be ignored.
//! Before reconstructing the shape, the algorithm will sort all
//! the given faces on the connected blocks (features).
//!
//! The features will be removed from the shape one by one.
//! It will allow removing all possible features even if there
//! were problems with the removal of some of them.
//!
//! The removed feature is filled by the extension of the faces adjacent
//! to the feature. In general, the algorithm of removing of the single
//! feature from the shape looks as follows:
//! - Find the faces adjacent to the feature;
//! - Extend the adjacent faces to cover the feature;
//! - Trim the extended faces by the bounds of original face
//!   (except for bounds common with the feature), so it will cover
//!   the feature only;
//! - Rebuild the solids with reconstructed adjacent faces
//!   avoiding the faces from the feature.
//!
//! If the removal is successful, the result is overwritten with the
//! new shape and the next feature is treated. Otherwise, the warning
//! will be given.
//!
//! The algorithm has the following options:
//! - History support;
//!
//! and the options available from base class:
//! - Error/Warning reporting system;
//! - Parallel processing mode.
//!
//! Please note that the other options of the base class are not supported
//! here and will have no effect.
//!
//! <b>History support</b> allows tracking modification of the input shape
//! in terms of Modified, IsDeleted and Generated. The history is
//! available through the methods of the history tool *BRepTools_History*,
//! which can be accessed here through the method *History()*.
//! By default, the history is collected, but it is possible to disable it
//! using the method *SetToFillHistory(false)*;
//!
//! <b>Error/Warning reporting system</b> - allows obtaining the extended overview
//! of the Errors/Warnings occurred during the operation. As soon as any error
//! appears the algorithm stops working. The warnings allow continuing the job,
//! informing the user that something went wrong.
//! The algorithm returns the following errors/warnings:
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertTooFewArguments* - the error alert is given if the input
//!     shape does not contain any solids;
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertUnsupportedType* - the warning alert is given if the input
//!     shape contains not only solids, but also other shapes;
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertNoFacesToRemove* - the error alert is given in case
//!     there are no faces to remove from the shape (nothing to do);
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertUnableToRemoveTheFeature* - the warning alert is given to
//!     inform the user the removal of the feature is not possible. The algorithm
//!     will still try to remove the other features;
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertRemoveFeaturesFailed* - the error alert is given in case if
//!     the operation was aborted by the unknown reason.
//!
//! <b>Parallel processing mode</b> - allows running the algorithm in parallel mode
//! obtaining the result faster.
//!
//! The algorithm has certain limitations:
//! - Intersection of the connected faces adjacent to the feature should not be empty.
//!   It means, that such faces should not be tangent to each other.
//!   If the intersection of the adjacent faces will be empty, the algorithm will
//!   be unable to trim the faces correctly and, most likely, the feature will not be removed.
//! - The algorithm does not process the INTERNAL parts of the solids, they are simply
//!   removed during reconstruction.
//!
//! Note that for successful removal of the feature, the extended faces adjacent
//! to the feature should cover the feature completely, otherwise the solids will
//! not be rebuild.
//!
//! Here is the example of usage of the algorithm:
//! ~~~~
//! TopoDS_Shape aSolid = ...;              // Input shape to remove the features from
//! TopTools_ListOfShape aFaces = ...;      // Faces to remove from the shape
//! Standard_Boolean bRunParallel = ...;    // Parallel processing mode
//! Standard_Boolean isHistoryNeeded = ...; // History support
//!
//! BOPAlgo_RemoveFeatures aRF;             // Feature removal algorithm
//! aRF.SetShape(aSolid);                   // Set the shape
//! aRF.AddFacesToRemove(aFaces);           // Add faces to remove
//! aRF.SetRunParallel(bRunParallel);       // Define the processing mode (parallel or single)
//! aRF.SetToFillHistory(isHistoryNeeded);  // Define whether to track the shapes modifications
//! aRF.Perform();                          // Perform the operation
//! if (aRF.HasErrors())                    // Check for the errors
//! {
//!   // error treatment
//!   return;
//! }
//! if (aRF.HasWarnings())                  // Check for the warnings
//! {
//!   // warnings treatment
//! }
//! const TopoDS_Shape& aResult = aRF.Shape(); // Result shape
//! ~~~~
//!
//! The algorithm preserves the type of the input shape in the result shape. Thus,
//! if the input shape is a COMPSOLID, the resulting solids will also be put into a COMPSOLID.
//!
//! When all possible features are removed, the shape is simplified by
//! removing extra edges and vertices, created during operation, from the result shape.
