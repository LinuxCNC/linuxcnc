//!
//! The class is a General Fuse algorithm - base algorithm for the
//! algorithms in the Boolean Component. Its main purpose is to build
//! the split parts of the argument shapes from which the result of
//! the operations is combined.<br>
//! The result of the General Fuse algorithm itself is a compound
//! containing all split parts of the arguments. <br>
//!
//! Additionally to the options of the base classes, the algorithm has
//! the following options:<br>
//! - *Safe processing mode* - allows to avoid modification of the input
//!                            shapes during the operation (by default it is off);<br>
//! - *Gluing options* - allows to speed up the calculation of the intersections
//!                      on the special cases, in which some sub-shapes are coinciding.<br>
//! - *Disabling the check for inverted solids* - Disables/Enables the check of the input solids
//!                          for inverted status (holes in the space). The default value is TRUE,
//!                          i.e. the check is performed. Setting this flag to FALSE for inverted solids,
//!                          most likely will lead to incorrect results.
//!
//! The algorithm returns the following warnings:
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertUnableToOrientTheShape* - in case the check on the orientation of the split shape
//!                                           to match the orientation of the original shape has failed.
//!
//! The algorithm returns the following Error statuses:
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertTooFewArguments* - in case there are no enough arguments to perform the operation;
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertNoFiller* - in case the intersection tool has not been created;
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertIntersectionFailed* - in case the intersection of the arguments has failed;
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertBuilderFailed* - in case building splits of arguments has failed with some unexpected error.

public: //! @name BOPs on open solids

  //! Builds the result shape according to the given states for the objects
  //! and tools. These states can be unambiguously converted into the Boolean operation type.
  //! Thus, it performs the Boolean operation on the given groups of shapes.
  //!
  //! The result is built basing on the result of Builder operation (GF or any other).
  //! The only condition for the Builder is that the splits of faces should be created
  //! and classified relatively solids.
  //!
  //! The method uses classification approach for choosing the faces which will
  //! participate in building the result shape:
  //! - All faces from each group having the given state for the opposite group
  //!   will be taken into result.
  //!
  //! Such approach shows better results (in comparison with BOPAlgo_BuilderSolid approach)
  //! when working with open solids. However, the result may not be always
  //! correct on such data (at least, not as expected) as the correct classification
  //! of the faces relatively open solids is not always possible and may vary
  //! depending on the chosen classification point on the face.
  //!
  //! History is not created for the solids in this method.
  //!
  //! To avoid pollution of the report of Builder algorithm, there is a possibility to pass
  //! the different report to collect the alerts of the method only. But, if the new report
  //! is not given, the Builder report will be used.
  //! So, even if Builder passed without any errors, but some error has been stored into its report
  //! in this method, for the following calls the Builder report must be cleared.
  //!
  //! The method may set the following errors:
  //! - BOPAlgo_AlertBuilderFailed - Building operation has not been performed yet or failed;
  //! - BOPAlgo_AlertBOPNotSet - invalid BOP type is given (COMMON/FUSE/CUT/CUT21 are supported);
  //! - BOPAlgo_AlertTooFewArguments - arguments are not given;
  //! - BOPAlgo_AlertUnknownShape - the shape is unknown for the operation.
  //!
  //! Parameters:
  //! @param theObjects     - The group of Objects for BOP;
  //! @param theObjState    - State for objects faces to pass into result;
  //! @param theTools       - The group of Tools for BOP;
  //! @param theToolsState  - State for tools faces to pass into result;
  //! @param theReport      - The alternative report to avoid pollution of the main one.

  //!          and vice versa.
  //! - FUSE   is built from the faces OUT of all given shapes;
