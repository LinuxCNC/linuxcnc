//! This class implements the algorithms used to
//! create 2d circles tangent to a curve and
//! centered on a point.
//! The arguments of all construction methods are :
//! - The qualified element for the tangency constrains
//! (QualifiedCurv).
//! -The center point Pcenter.
//! - A real Tolerance.
//! Tolerance is only used in the limits cases.
//! For example :
//! We want to create a circle tangent to an EnclosedCurv C1
//! with a tolerance Tolerance.
//! If we did not used Tolerance it is impossible to
//! find a solution in the following case : Pcenter is
//! outside C1.
//! With Tolerance we will give a solution if the distance
//! between C1 and Pcenter is lower than or equal Tolerance/2.

  //! Constructs one or more 2D circles tangential to the
  //! curve Qualified1 and centered on the point Pcenter.
  //! Tolerance is a tolerance criterion used by the algorithm
  //! to find a solution when, mathematically, the problem
  //! posed does not have a solution, but where there is
  //! numeric uncertainty attached to the arguments.
  //! Tolerance is only used in these algorithms in very
  //! specific cases where the center of the solution is very
  //! close to the circle to which it is tangential, and where the
  //! solution is thus a very small circle.
  //! Exceptions
  //! GccEnt_BadQualifier if a qualifier is inconsistent with
  //! the argument it qualifies (for example, enclosing for a line).
