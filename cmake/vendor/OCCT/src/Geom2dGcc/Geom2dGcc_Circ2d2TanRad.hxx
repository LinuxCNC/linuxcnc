//! This class implements the algorithms used to
//! create 2d circles tangent to one curve and a
//! point/line/circle/curv and with a given radius.
//! For each construction methods arguments are:
//! - Two Qualified elements for tangency constrains.
//! (for example EnclosedCirc if we want the
//! solution inside the argument EnclosedCirc).
//! - Two Reals. One (Radius) for the radius and the
//! other (Tolerance) for the tolerance.
//! Tolerance is only used for the limit cases.
//! For example :
//! We want to create a circle inside a circle C1 and
//! inside a curve Cu2 with a radius Radius and a
//! tolerance Tolerance.
//! If we did not used Tolerance it is impossible to
//! find a solution in the following case : Cu2 is
//! inside C1 and there is no intersection point
//! between the two elements.
//! with Tolerance we will give a solution if the
//! lowest distance between C1 and Cu2 is lower than or
//! equal Tolerance.

  //! These constructors create one or more 2D circles of radius Radius either
  //! -   tangential to the 2 curves Qualified1 and Qualified2,   or
  //! -   tangential to the curve Qualified1 and passing through the point Point, or
  //! -   passing through two points Point1 and Point2.
  //! Tolerance is a tolerance criterion used by the algorithm
  //! to find a solution when, mathematically, the problem
  //! posed does not have a solution, but where there is
  //! numeric uncertainty attached to the arguments.
  //! For example, take two circles C1 and C2, such that C2
  //! is inside C1, and almost tangential to C1. There is, in
  //! fact, no point of intersection between C1 and C2. You
  //! now want to find a circle of radius R (smaller than the
  //! radius of C2), which is tangential to C1 and C2, and
  //! inside these two circles: a pure mathematical resolution
  //! will not find a solution. This is where the tolerance
  //! criterion is used: the algorithm considers that C1 and
  //! C2 are tangential if the shortest distance between these
  //! two circles is less than or equal to Tolerance. Thus, a
  //! solution is found by the algorithm.
  //! Exceptions
  //! GccEnt_BadQualifier if a qualifier is inconsistent with
  //! the argument it qualifies (for example, enclosing for a line).
  //! Standard_NegativeValue if Radius is negative.
