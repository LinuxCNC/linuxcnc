//! Describes functions for building a qualified 2D curve.
//! A qualified 2D curve is a curve with a qualifier which
//! specifies whether the solution of a construction
//! algorithm using the qualified curve (as an argument):
//! -   encloses the curve, or
//! -   is enclosed by the curve, or
//! -   is built so that both the curve and it are external to one another, or
//! -   is undefined (all solutions apply).
class Geom2dGcc_QualifiedCurve 
{

  DEFINE_STANDARD_ALLOC

  
  //! Constructs a qualified curve by assigning the qualifier
  //! Qualifier to the curve Curve. Qualifier may be:
  //! -   GccEnt_enclosing if the solution of a construction
  //! algorithm using the qualified curve encloses the curve, or
  //! -   GccEnt_enclosed if the solution is enclosed by the curve, or
  //! -   GccEnt_outside if both the solution and the curve
  //! are external to one another, or
  //! -   GccEnt_unqualified if all solutions apply.
  //! Note: The interior of a curve is defined as the left-hand
  //! side of the curve in relation to its orientation.
  //! Warning
  //! Curve is an adapted curve, i.e. an object which is an interface between:
  //! -   the services provided by a 2D curve from the package Geom2d,
  //! -   and those required on the curve by a computation algorithm.
  //! The adapted curve is created in the following way:
  //! Handle(Geom2d_Curve) mycurve = ... ;
  //! Geom2dAdaptor_Curve Curve ( mycurve ) ;
  //! The qualified curve is then constructed with this object:
  //! GccEnt_Position myQualif = GccEnt_outside ;
  //! Geom2dGcc_QualifiedCurve myQCurve ( Curve, myQualif );
  //! is private;

  //! Returns a 2D curve to which the qualifier is assigned.
  //! Warning
  //! The returned curve is an adapted curve, i.e. an object
  //! which is an interface between:
  //! -   the services provided by a 2D curve from the package Geom2d,
  //! -   and those required on the curve by a computation algorithm.
  //! The Geom2d curve on which the adapted curve is
  //! based can be obtained in the following way:
  //! myQualifiedCurve = ... ;
  //! Geom2dAdaptor_Curve myAdaptedCurve = myQualifiedCurve.Qualified();
  //! Handle(Geom2d_Curve) = myAdaptedCurve.Curve();
