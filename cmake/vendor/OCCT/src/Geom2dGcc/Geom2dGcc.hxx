//! The Geom2dGcc package describes qualified 2D
//! curves used in the construction of constrained geometric
//! objects by an algorithm provided by the Geom2dGcc package.
//! A qualified 2D curve is a curve with a qualifier which
//! specifies whether the solution of a construction
//! algorithm using the qualified curve (as an argument):
//! -   encloses the curve, or
//! -   is enclosed by the curve, or
//! -   is built so that both the curve and this solution are external to one another, or
//! -   is undefined (all solutions apply).
//! These package methods provide simpler functions to construct a qualified curve.
//! Note: the interior of a curve is defined as the left-hand
//! side of the curve in relation to its orientation.
