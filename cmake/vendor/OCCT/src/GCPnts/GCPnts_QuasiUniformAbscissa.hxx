  //! on the part of curve limited by the two parameter values theU1 and theU2,
  //! where Abscissa is the curvilinear distance between

  //! The first point of the distribution is either the origin of
  //! curve or the point of parameter theU1.
  //! The following points are computed such that the curvilinear
  //! distance between two consecutive points is equal to Abscissa.
  //! The last point of the distribution is either the end
  //! point of curve or the point of parameter theU2.
  //! However the curvilinear distance between this last
  //! point and the point just preceding it in the distribution is,
  //! of course, generally not equal to Abscissa.
  //! Use the function IsDone() to verify that the computation was successful,
  //! the function NbPoints() to obtain the number of points of the computed distribution,
  //! and the function Parameter() to read the parameter of each point.
