DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(ShapeFix_ComposeShell, ShapeFix_Root)

//! This class is intended to create a shell from the composite
//! surface (grid of surfaces) and set of wires.
//! It may be either division of the supporting surface of the
//! face, or creating a shape corresponding to face on composite
//! surface which is missing in CAS.CADE but exists in some other
//! systems.
//!
//! It splits (if necessary) original face to several ones by
//! splitting lines which are joint lines on a supplied grid of
//! surfaces (U- and V- isolines of the  composite surface).
//! There are two modes of work, which differ in the way of
//! handling faces on periodic surfaces:
//!
//! - if ClosedMode is False (default), when splitting itself is
//! done as if surface were not periodic. The periodicity of the
//! underlying surface is taken into account by duplicating splitting
//! lines in the periodic direction, as necessary to split all
//! the wires (whole parametrical range of a face)
//! In this mode, some regularization procedures are performed
//! (indexation of split segments by patch numbers), and it is
//! expected to be more reliable and robust in case of bad shapes
//!
//! - if ClosedMode is True, when everything on a periodic surfaces
//! is considered as modulo period. This allows to deal with wires
//! which are closed in 3d but not in 2d, with wires which may be
//! shifted on several periods in 2d etc. However, this mode is
//! less reliable since some regularizations do not work for it.
//!
//! The work is made basing on pcurves of the edges. These pcurves
//! should already exist (for example, in the case of division of
//! existing face), then they are taken as is. The existing pcurves
//! should be assigned to one surface (face) for all edges,
//! this surface (face) will be used only for accessing pcurves,
//! and it may have any geometry.
//!
//! All the modifications are recorded in the context tool
//! (ShapeBuild_ReShape).
