//! This class implements the following algorithms used to

  //! --- Purpose ;
  //! Creates a parabola with its local coordinate system "A2"
  //! and it's focal length "Focal".
  //! The XDirection of A2 defines the axis of symmetry of the
  //! parabola. The YDirection of A2 is parallel to the directrix
  //! of the parabola. The Location point of A2 is the vertex of
  //! the parabola
  //! The status is "NullFocusLength" if Focal < 0.0
  Standard_EXPORT gce_MakeParab(const gp_Ax2& A2, const Standard_Real Focal);
  

  //! D is the directrix of the parabola and F the focus point.
  //! The symmetry axis (XAxis) of the parabola is normal to the
  //! directrix and pass through the focus point F, but its
  //! location point is the vertex of the parabola.
  //! The YAxis of the parabola is parallel to D and its location
  //! point is the vertex of the parabola. The normal to the plane
  //! of the parabola is the cross product between the XAxis and the
  //! YAxis.
  Standard_EXPORT gce_MakeParab(const gp_Ax1& D, const gp_Pnt& F);
  
  //! Returns the constructed parabola.
  //! Exceptions StdFail_NotDone if no parabola is constructed.
