//! This class implements the following algorithms used to

//! * Create a 2d Hyperbola from its center and two points:
//! one on its axis of symmetry giving the major radius, the
//! other giving the value of the small radius.
//! * Create a 2d Hyperbola from its major axis and its major
//! radius and its minor radius.

//! An axis placement (one axis) is associated with the hyperbola.
//! This axis is the "XAxis" or major axis of the hyperbola. It is
//! the symmetry axis of the main branch of hyperbola.
//! The "YAxis" is normal to this axis and pass through its location
//! point. It is the minor axis.
//!
//! The major radius is the distance between the Location point
//! of the hyperbola C and the vertex of the Main Branch (or the
//! Other branch). The minor radius is the distance between the
//! Location point of the hyperbola C and the vertex of the First
//! (or Second) Conjugate branch.
//! The major radius can be lower than the minor radius.
