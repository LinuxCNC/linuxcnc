//! Defines an infinite parabola.
//! An axis placement one axis defines the local cartesian
//! coordinate system ("XAxis") of the parabola.
//! The vertex of the parabola is the "Location" point of the
//! local coordinate system of the parabola.
//! The "XAxis" of the parabola is its axis of symmetry.
//! The "XAxis" is oriented from the vertex of the parabola to the
//! Focus of the parabola.
//! The "YAxis" is parallel to the directrix of the parabola and
//! its "Location" point is the vertex of the parabola.
//! The equation of the parabola in the local coordinate system is
//! Y**2 = (2*P) * X
//! P is the distance between the focus and the directrix of the

//! The focal length F = P/2 is the distance between the vertex
//! and the focus of the parabola.

//! * Create a Parab2d from one apex  and the center.
//! * Create a Parab2d with the directrix and the focus point.
//! * Create a Parab2d with its vertex point and its axis
