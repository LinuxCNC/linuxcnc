//! This class implements the following algorithms used to
//! create Hyperbola from gp.
//! * Create an Hyperbola from its center, and two points:
//! one on its axis of symmetry giving the major radius, the
//! other giving the value of the small radius.
//! The three points give the plane of the hyperbola.
//! * Create an hyperbola from its axisplacement and its
//! MajorRadius and its MinorRadius.

//! The local cartesian coordinate system of the ellipse is an
//! axis placement (two axis).
//!
//! The "XDirection" and the "YDirection" of the axis placement
//! define the plane of the hyperbola.
//!
//! The "Direction" of the axis placement defines the normal axis
//! to the hyperbola's plane.
//!
//! The "XAxis" of the hyperbola ("Location", "XDirection") is the
//! major axis  and the  "YAxis" of the hyperbola ("Location",
//! "YDirection") is the minor axis.
//!
//! Warnings :
//! The major radius (on the major axis) can be lower than the
//! minor radius (on the minor axis).

  //! A2 is the local coordinate system of the hyperbola.
  //! In the local coordinates system A2 the equation of the
  //! hyperbola is :
  //! X*X / MajorRadius*MajorRadius - Y*Y / MinorRadius*MinorRadius = 1.0
  //! It is not forbidden to create an Hyperbola with MajorRadius =
  //! MinorRadius.
  //! For the hyperbola the MajorRadius can be lower than the
  //! MinorRadius.
  //! The status is "NegativeRadius" if MajorRadius < 0.0 and
  //! "InvertRadius" if MinorRadius > MajorRadius.
