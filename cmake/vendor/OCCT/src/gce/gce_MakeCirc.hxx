//! This class implements the following algorithms used

//!
//! * Create a Circ coaxial to another and passing

//! * Create a Circ coaxial to another at the distance
//! Dist.
//! * Create a Circ passing through 3 points.
//! * Create a Circ with its center and the normal of its
//! plane and its radius.
//! * Create a Circ with its center and its plane and its
//! radius.
//! * Create a Circ with its axis and radius.
//! * Create a Circ with two points giving its axis and
//! its radius.
//! * Create a Circ with is Ax2 and its Radius.
