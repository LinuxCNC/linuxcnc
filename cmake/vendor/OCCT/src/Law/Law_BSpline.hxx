//! Definition of the 1D B_spline curve.
//!
//! Uniform  or non-uniform
//! Rational or non-rational
//! Periodic or non-periodic
//!
//! a b-spline curve is defined by :
//!
//! The Degree (up to 25)
//!
//! The Poles  (and the weights if it is rational)
//!
//! The Knots and Multiplicities
//!
//! The knot vector   is an  increasing  sequence  of
//! reals without  repetition. The multiplicities are
//! the repetition of the knots.
//!
//! If the knots are regularly spaced (the difference
//! of two  consecutive  knots  is a   constant), the
//! knots repartition is :
//!
//! - Uniform if all multiplicities are 1.
//!
//! -  Quasi-uniform if  all multiplicities are  1
//! but the first and the last which are Degree+1.
//!
//! -   PiecewiseBezier if  all multiplicities are
//! Degree but the   first and the  last which are
//! Degree+1.
//!
//! The curve may be periodic.
//!
//! On a periodic curve if there are k knots and p
//! poles. the period is knot(k) - knot(1)
//!
//! the poles and knots are infinite vectors with :
//!
//! knot(i+k) = knot(i) + period
//!
//! pole(i+p) = pole(i)
