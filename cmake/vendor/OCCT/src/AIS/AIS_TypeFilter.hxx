//! Selects Interactive Objects through their types. The
//! filter questions each Interactive Object in local context
//! to determine whether it has an non-null owner, and if
//! so, whether it is of the desired type. If the object
//! returns true in each case, it is kept. If not, it is rejected.
//! By default, the   interactive object has a None   type
//! and a signature of 0. A filter for type specifies a
//! choice of type out of a range at any level enumerated
//! for type or kind. The choice could be for kind of
//! interactive object, of dimension, of unit, or type of axis,
//! plane or attribute.
//! If you want to give a particular type and signature to
//! your Interactive Object, you must redefine two virtual
//! methods:   Type and Signature.
//! This filter is used in both Neutral Point and open local contexts.
//! In the Collector viewer, you can only locate
//! Interactive Objects which answer positively to the
//! positioned filters when a local context is open.
//! Warning
//! When you close a local context, all temporary
//! interactive objects are deleted, all selection modes
//! concerning the context are cancelled, and all content
//! filters are emptied.
