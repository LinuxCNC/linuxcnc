  //! This function checks whether a given shape is valid by checking that:
  //! -      the topology is correct
  //! -      parameterization of edges in particular is correct.
  //! For the topology to be correct, the following conditions must be satisfied:
  //! -      edges should have at least two vertices if they are not
  //! degenerate edges. The vertices should be within the range of
  //! the bounding edges at the tolerance specified in the vertex,
  //! -      edges should share at least one face. The representation of
  //! the edges should be within the tolerance criterion assigned to them.
  //! -      wires defining a face should not self-intersect and should be closed,
  //! - there should be one wire which contains all other wires inside a face,
  //! -      wires should be correctly oriented with respect to each of the edges,
  //! -      faces should be correctly oriented, in particular with
  //! respect to adjacent faces if these faces define a solid,
  //! -      shells defining a solid should be closed. There should
  //! be one enclosing shell if the shape is a solid;
  //! To check parameterization of edge, there are 2 approaches depending on
  //! the edge?s contextual situation.
  //! -      if the edge is either single, or it is in the context
  //! of a wire or a compound, its parameterization is defined by
  //! the parameterization of its 3D curve and is considered as    valid.
  //! -      If the edge is in the context of a face, it should
  //! have SameParameter and SameRange flags set to Standard_True. To
  //! check these flags, you should call the function
  //! BRep_Tool::SameParameter and BRep_Tool::SameRange for an
  //! edge. If at least one of these flags is set to Standard_False,
  //! the edge is considered as invalid without any additional check.
  //! If the edge is contained by a face, and it has SameParameter and
  //! SameRange flags set to Standard_True, IsValid checks
  //! whether representation of the edge on face, in context of which the
  //! edge is considered, has the same parameterization up to the
  //! tolerance value coded on the edge. For a given parameter t on the edge
  //! having C as a 3D curve and one PCurve P on a surface S (base
  //! surface of the reference face), this checks that |C(t) - S(P(t))|
  //! is less than or equal to tolerance, where tolerance is the tolerance
  //! value coded on the edge.
