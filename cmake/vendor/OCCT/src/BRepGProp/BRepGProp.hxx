//! Provides global functions to compute a shape's global

//! - its matrix of inertia,
//! - its moment about an axis,
//! - its radius of gyration about an axis,

  //! Computes the linear global properties of the shape S,
  //! i.e. the global properties induced by each edge of the
  //! shape S, and brings them together with the global
  //! properties still retained by the framework LProps. If
  //! the current system of LProps was empty, its global
  //! properties become equal to the linear global
  //! properties of S.
  //! For this computation no linear density is attached to
  //! the edges. So, for example, the added mass
  //! corresponds to the sum of the lengths of the edges of
  //! S. The density of the composed systems, i.e. that of
  //! each component of the current system of LProps, and
  //! that of S which is considered to be equal to 1, must be coherent.
  //! Note that this coherence cannot be checked. You are
  //! advised to use a separate framework for each
  //! density, and then to bring these frameworks together
  //! into a global one.
  //! The point relative to which the inertia of the system is
  //! computed is the reference point of the framework LProps.
  //! Note: if your programming ensures that the framework
  //! LProps retains only linear global properties (brought
  //! together for example, by the function
  //! LinearProperties) for objects the density of which is
  //! equal to 1 (or is not defined), the function Mass will
  //! return the total length of edges of the system analysed by LProps.
  //! Warning
  //! No check is performed to verify that the shape S
  //! retains truly linear properties. If S is simply a vertex, it
  //! is not considered to present any additional global properties.
  //! SkipShared is a special flag, which allows taking in calculation 
  //! shared topological entities or not.
  //! For ex., if SkipShared = True, edges, shared by two or more faces, 
  //! are taken into calculation only once.
  //! If we have cube with sizes 1, 1, 1, its linear properties = 12 
  //! for SkipEdges = true and 24 for SkipEdges = false.
  //! UseTriangulation is a special flag, which defines preferable 
  //! source of geometry data. If UseTriangulation = Standard_False,
  //! exact geometry objects (curves) are used, otherwise polygons of 
  //! triangulation are used first.
