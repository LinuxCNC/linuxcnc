class FilletPoint;

//! Algorithm that creates fillet edge: arc tangent to two edges in the start
//! and in the end vertices. Initial edges must be located on the plane and 
//! must be connected by the end or start points (shared vertices are not 
//! obligatory). Created fillet arc is created with the given radius, that is
//! useful in sketcher applications.
//! 
//! The algorithm is iterative that allows to create fillet on any curves
//! of initial edges, that supports projection of point and C2 continuous.
//! Principles of algorithm can de reduced to the Newton method:
//! 1. Splitting initial edge into N segments where probably only 1 root can be
//!    found. N depends on the complexity of the underlying curve.
//! 2. On each segment compute value and derivative of the function:
//!    - argument of the function is the parameter on the curve
//!    - take point on the curve by the parameter: point of tangency
//!    - make center of fillet: perpendicular vector from the point of tagency
//!    - make projection from the center to the second curve
//!    - length of the projection minus radius of the fillet is result of the 
//!      function
//!    - derivative of this function in the point is computed by value in 
//!      point with small shift
//! 3. Using Newton search method take the point on the segment where function
//!    value is most close to zero. If it is not enough close, step 2 and 3 are
//!    repeated taking as start or end point the found point.
//! 4. If solution is found, result is created on point on root of the function (as a start point),
//!    point of the projection onto second curve (as an end point) and center of arc in found center.
//!    Initial edges are cut by the start and end point of tangency.
