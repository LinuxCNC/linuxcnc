//! SignCounter gives the frame to count signatures associated
//! with entities, deducted from them. Ex.: their Dynamic Type.
//!
//! It can sort a set of Entities according a signature, i.e. :
//! - list of different values found for this Signature
//! - for each one, count and list of entities
//! Results are returned as a SignatureList, which can be queried
//! on the count (list of strings, count per signature, or list of
//! entities per signature)
//!
//! A SignCounter can be filled, either directly from lists, or
//! from the result of a Selection : hence, its content can be
//! automatically recomputed as desired
//!
//! SignCounter works by using a Signature in its method AddSign
//!
//! Methods can be redefined to, either
//! - directly compute the value without a Signature
//! - compute the value in the context of a Graph
