//! A SessionDumper is called by SessionFile. It takes into
//! account a set of classes (such as Selections, Dispatches ...).
//! SessionFile writes the Type (as defined by cdl) of each Item
//! and its general Parameters. It manages the names of the Items.
//!
//! A SessionDumper must be able to Write the Parameters which are
//! own of each Item it takes into account, given its Class, then
//! to Recognize the Type and Read its Own Parameters to create
//! an Item of this Type with these own Parameters.
//!
//! Then, there must be defined one sub-type of SessionDumper per
//! consistent set of classes (e.g. a package).
//!
//! By Own Parameters, understand Parameters given at Creation Time
//! if there are, or specific of a given class, apart from those
//! defined at superclass levels (e.g. Final Selection for a
//! Dispatch, Input Selection for a SelectExtract or SelectDeduct,
//! Direct Status for a SelectExtract, etc...).
//!
//! The Parameters are those stored in a WorkSession, they can be
//! of Types : IntParam, HAsciiString (for TextParam), Selection,
//! Dispatch.
//!
//! SessionDumpers are organized in a Library which is used by
//! SessionFile. They are put at Creation Time in this Library.
