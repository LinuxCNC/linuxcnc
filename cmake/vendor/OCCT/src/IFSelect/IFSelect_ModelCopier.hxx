//! This class performs the Copy operations involved by the
//! description of a ShareOut (evaluated by a ShareOutResult)
//! plus, if there are, the Modifications on the results, with
//! the help of Modifiers. Each Modifier can work on one or more
//! resulting packets, according to its criteria : it operates on
//! a Model once copied and filled with the content of the packet.
//!
//! Modifiers can be :
//! - Model Modifiers, inheriting from the specific class Modifier
//! able to run on the content of a Model (header or entities),
//! activated by the ModelCopier itself
//! - File Modifiers, inheriting directly from GeneralModifier,
//! intended to be activated under the control of a WorkLibrary,
//! once the Model has been produced (i.e. to act on output
//! format, or other specific file features)
//!
//! The Copy operations can be :
//! - immediately put to files : for each packet, a Model is
//! created and filled, then the file is output, at that's all
//! - memorized : for each packet, a Model is created and filled,
//! it is memorized with the corresponding file name.
//! it is possible to query the result of memorization (list of
//! produced Models and their file names)
//! -> it is also possible to send it into the files :
//! once files are written, the result is cleared
//!
//! In addition, a list of really written files is managed :
//! A first call to BeginSentFiles clears the list and commands,
//! either to begin a new list, or to stop recording it. A call
//! to SentFiles returns the list (if recording has been required)
//! This list allows to globally exploit the set of produced files
//!
//! Remark : For operations which concern specific Entities, see
//! also in package IFAdapt : a sub-class of ModelCopier allows
//! to work with EntityModifier, in addition to Modifier itself
//! which still applies to a whole copied Model.
