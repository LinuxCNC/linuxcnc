//! This class allows to describe how a set of Entities has to be
//! dispatched into resulting Packets : a Packet is a sub-set of
//! the initial set of entities.
//!
//! Thus, it can generate zero, one, or more Packets according
//! input set and criterium of dispatching. And it can let apart
//! some entities : it is the Remainder, which can be recovered
//! by a specific Selection (RemainderFromDispatch).
//!
//! Depending of sub-classes, a Dispatch can potentially generate
//! a limited or not count of packet, and a remainder or none.
//!
//! The input set is read from a specified Selection, attached to
//! the Dispatch : the Final Selection of the Dispatch. The input
//! is the Unique Root Entities list of the Final Selection
