//! This class defines the (empty) frame which can be used to

//! In particular, a specific WorkLibrary must give the way for
//! Reading a File into a Model, and Writing a Model to a File
//! Thus, it is possible to define several Work Libraries for each
//! norm, but recommended to define one general class for each one :
//! this general class will define the Read and Write methods.
//!
//! Also a Dump service is provided, it can produce, according the
//! norm, either a parcel of a file for an entity, or any other
//! kind of information relevant for the norm,
