//! A SelectAnyList kind Selection selects a List of an Entity, as
//! well as this Entity contains some. A List contains sub-entities
//! as one per Item, or several (for instance if an Entity binds
//! couples of sub-entities, each item is one of these couples).
//! Remark that only Entities are taken into account (neither
//! Reals, nor Strings, etc...)
//!
//! To define the list on which to work, SelectAnyList has two
//! deferred methods : NbItems (which gives the length of the
//! list), FillResult (which fills an EntityIterator). They are
//! intended to get a List in an Entity of the required Type (and
//! consider that list is empty if Entity has not required Type)
//!
//! In addition, remark that some types of Entity define more than
//! one list in each instance : a given sub-class of SelectAnyList
//! must be attached to one list
//!
//! SelectAnyList keeps or rejects a sub-set of the list,
//! that is the Items of which rank in the list is in a given
//! range (for instance form 2nd to 6th, etc...)
//! Range is defined by two Integer values. In order to allow
//! external control of them, these values are not directly
//! defined as fields, but accessed through IntParams, that is,
//! referenced as Transient (Handle) objects
//!
//! Warning : the Input can be any kind of Selection, BUT its
//! RootResult must have zero (empty) or one Entity maximum
