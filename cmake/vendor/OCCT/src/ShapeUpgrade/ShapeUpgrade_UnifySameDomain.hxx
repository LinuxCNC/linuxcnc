//! This tool tries to unify faces and edges of the shape which lie on the same geometry.
//! Faces/edges are considering as 'same-domain' if a group of neighbouring faces/edges
//! are lying on coincident surfaces/curves.
//! In this case these faces/edges can be unified into one face/edge.
//! ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain is initialized by a shape and the next optional parameters:
//! UnifyFaces - tries to unify all possible faces
//! UnifyEdges - tries to unify all possible edges
//! ConcatBSplines - if this flag is set to true then all neighbouring edges, which lay
//! on BSpline or Bezier curves with C1 continuity on their common vertices,
//! will be merged into one common edge.
//!
//! The input shape can be of any type containing faces or edges - compsolid, solid, shell, 
//! wire, compound of any kind of shapes. The algorithm preserves the structure of compsolids,
//! solids, shells and wires. E.g., if two shells have a common edge and the faces sharing
//! this edge lie on the same surface the algorithm will not unify these faces, otherwise 
//! the structure of shells would be broken. However, if such faces belong to different
//! compounds of faces they will be unified.
//! 
//! The output result of the tool is the unified shape.
//!
//! All the modifications of initial shape are recorded during unifying.
//! Methods History are intended to: <br>
//! - set a place holder for the history of modifications of sub-shapes of
//!   the initial shape; <br>
//! - get the collected history. <br>
//! The algorithm provides a place holder for the history and collects the
//! history by default.
//! To avoid collecting of the history the place holder should be set to null handle.
