//! A framework for computing the global properties of a
//! set of points.
//! A point mass is attached to each point. The global
//! mass of the system is the sum of each individual
//! mass. By default, the point mass is equal to 1 and the
//! mass of a system composed of N points is equal to N.
//! Warning
//! A framework of this sort provides functions to handle
//! sets of points easily. But, like any GProp_GProps
//! object, by using the Add function, it can theoretically
//! bring together the computed global properties and
//! those of a system more complex than a set of points .
//! The mass of each point and the density of each
//! component of the composed system must be
//! coherent. Note that this coherence cannot be checked.
//! Nonetheless, you are advised to restrict your use of a
//! GProp_PGProps object to a set of points and to
//! create a GProp_GProps object in order to bring
//! together global properties of different systems.

  //! The point relative to which the inertia of the system is
  //! computed will be the origin (0, 0, 0) of the

  //! At initialization, the framework is empty, i.e. it retains
  //! no dimensional information such as mass and inertia.
  //! It is, however, now able to keep global properties of a
  //! set of points while new points are added using the
  //! AddPoint function.
  //! The set of points whose global properties are brought
  //! together by this framework will then be referred to as
  //! the current system. The current system is, however,
  //! not kept by this framework, which only keeps that
  //! system's global properties. Note that the current
  //! system may be more complex than a set of points.
