  //! -   the mean point if the points in question are
  //! considered to be coincident within the precision Tol, or
  //! -   the mean line if they are considered to be
  //! collinear within the precision Tol, or
  //! -   the mean plane if they are considered to be
  //! coplanar within the precision Tol, or
  //! -   the minimal box which contains all the points. Use :
  //! -   the functions IsPoint, IsLinear, IsPlanar
  //! and IsSpace to find the result of the analysis, and
  //! -   the function Point, Line, Plane or Box to
  //! access the computed result.

  //! This box is centered on the barycenter P of the
