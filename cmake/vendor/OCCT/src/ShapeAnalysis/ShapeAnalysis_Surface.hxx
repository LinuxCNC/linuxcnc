//! Complements standard tool Geom_Surface by providing additional
//! functionality for detection surface singularities, checking
//! spatial surface closure and computing projections of 3D points
//! onto a surface.
//!
//! * The singularities
//! Each singularity stores the precision with which corresponding
//! surface iso-line is considered as degenerated.
//! The number of singularities is determined by specifying precision
//! and always not greater than 4.
//!
//! * The spatial closure
//! The check for spatial closure is performed with given precision
//! (default value is Precision::Confusion).
//! If Geom_Surface says that the surface is closed, this class
//! also says this. Otherwise additional analysis is performed.
//!
//! * The parameters of 3D point on the surface
//! The projection of the point is performed with given precision.
//! This class tries to find a solution taking into account possible
//! singularities.
//! Additional method for searching the solution from already built
//! one is also provided.
//!
//! This tool is optimised: computes most information only once
