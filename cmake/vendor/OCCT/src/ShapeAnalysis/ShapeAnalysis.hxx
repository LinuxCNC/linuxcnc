//! This package is intended to analyze geometrical objects
//! and topological shapes. Analysis domain includes both
//! exploring geometrical and topological properties of
//! shapes and checking their conformance to Open CASCADE requirements.
//! The directions of analysis provided by tools of this package are:
//! computing quantities of subshapes,
//! computing parameters of points on curve and surface,
//! computing surface singularities,
//! checking edge and wire consistency,
//! checking edges order in the wire,
//! checking face bounds orientation,
//! checking small faces,
//! analyzing shape tolerances,
//! analyzing of free bounds of the shape.

  //! wire  : V1 is start vertex of the first edge, V2 is end vertex
  //! of the last edge (also see ShapeAnalysis_Edge).
