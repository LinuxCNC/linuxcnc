# This TCL script demonstrates memory leak in OCAF Undo/Redo
#
# The DRAW command TestOCAF (provided separately) just reads 
# the specified brep file
# and puts it into the document on a given label.
# This operation is done and undone several times,
# and the problem is that each time additional memory
# (approximately equivalent to the size of shape)
# is consumed.
#
# While obviously it should not be so: even if Undo keeps the 
# shape in memory as delta on Redo, this delta should be cleared 
# by the next operation!
#
# The bug persists with any setting of variables MMGT_OPT and MMGT_MMAP
# (while with different initial size and step) and 
#
# It seems that either delta is not completely freed, or some
# other data structures keep the shape memory
