OCAF: Function Mechanism {#samples__ocaf_func}
========================

Let us describe the usage of the "Function Mechanism" of Open CASCADE Application Framework on a simple example.  
This example represents a "nail" composed by a cone and two cylinders of different radius and height:  

@image html ocaf_functionmechanism_wp_image003.png "A nail"
@image latex ocaf_functionmechanism_wp_image003.png " A nail"

  These three objects (a cone and two cylinders) are  independent, 
  but the Function Mechanism makes them connected to each other and representing one object -- a nail.  
  The object "nail" has the following parameters:  
  
  * The position of the nail is defined by the apex point of the  cone. 
   The cylinders are built on the cone and therefore they depend on the position  of the cone. 
   In this way we define a dependency of the cylinders on the cone.  
  * The height of the nail is defined by the height of the cone.  
   Let’s consider that the long cylinder has 3 heights of the cone 
   and the header cylinder has a half of the height of the cone.  
  * The radius of the nail is defined by the radius of the cone. 
  The radius of the long cylinder coincides with this value. 
  Let’s consider that the  header cylinder has one and a half radiuses of the cone.  
  
  So, the cylinders depend on the cone and the cone  parameters define the size of the nail.  
  
  It means that re-positioning the cone (changing its  apex point) moves the nail, 
  the change of the radius of the cone produces a thinner or thicker nail, 
  and the change of the height of the cone shortens or  prolongates the nail.  
   It is suggested to examine the programming steps needed to create a 3D parametric model of the "nail".  
  
## Step1: Data Tree

  The first step consists in model data allocation in the OCAF tree. 
  In other words, it is necessary to decide where to put the data.  
  
  In this case, the data can be organized into a simple tree 
  using references for definition of dependent parameters:  

* Nail
	* Cone
		+ Position (x,y,z)
		+ Radius 
		+ Height
	* Cylinder (stem)
		+ Position = "Cone" position translated for "Cone" height along Z;
		+ Radius = "Cone" radius;
		+ Height = "Cone" height multiplied by 3;
	* Cylinder (head)  
		+ Position = "Long cylinder" position translated for "Long cylinder" height along Z;
		+ Radius = "Long cylinder" radius multiplied by 1.5;
		+ Height = "Cone" height divided by 2. 

  The "nail" object has three sub-leaves in the tree:  the cone and two cylinders.   
  
  The cone object is independent.  
  
  The long cylinder representing a "stem" of the nail  refers to the corresponding parameters 
  of the cone to define its own data  (position, radius and height). It means that the long cylinder depends on the  cone.  
  
  The parameters of the head cylinder may be expressed  through the cone parameters 
  only or through the cone and the long cylinder  parameters. 
  It is suggested to express the position and the radius of the head cylinder 
  through the position and the radius of the long cylinder, and the height 
  of the head cylinder through the height of the cone. 
  It means that the head cylinder depends on the cone and the long cylinder.  

## Step 2: Interfaces

  The interfaces of the data model are responsible for dynamic creation 
  of the data tree of the represented at the previous step, data  modification and deletion.  
  
  The interface called *INail*  should contain the methods for creation 
  of the data tree for the nail, setting  and getting of its parameters, computation, visualization and removal.  

### Creation of the nail

  This method of the interface creates a data tree for the nail  at a given leaf of OCAF data tree.  
  
  It creates three sub-leaves for the cone and two cylinders  and allocates the necessary data (references at the 
sub-leaves of the long and the  head cylinders).  
  
  It sets the default values of position, radius and height of  the nail.  
  
  The nail has the following user parameters:  
  * The position -- coincides with the position of the cone  
  * The radius of the stem part of the nail -- coincides with the radius  of the cone  
  * The height of the nail -- a sum of heights of the cone and both  cylinders  
  
  The values of the position and the radius of the  nail are defined for the cone object data. 
  The height of the cone is recomputed  as 2 * heights of nail and divided by 9.  

### Computation

  The Function Mechanism is responsible for re-computation of  the nail. 
  It will be described in detail later in this document.  
  
  A data leaf consists of the reference  to the location of the  real data 
  and a real value defining a coefficient of multiplication of the  referenced data.  
  
  For example, the height of the long cylinder is defined as a  reference to the height of the cone 
  with coefficient 3. The data  leaf of the height of the long cylinder 
  should contain two attributes: a  reference to the height of cone and a real value equal to 3.  

### Visualization

 The shape resulting of the nail function can be displayed using the standard OCAF visualization mechanism.  

### Removal of the nail

To automatically erase the nail from the viewer and the data  tree it is enough to clean the nail leaf from attributes.  

## Step 3: Functions

  The nail is defined by four functions: the cone, the two cylinders  and the nail function.  
  The function of the cone is independent. The functions of the cylinders depend on the cone function. 
  The nail function depends on the  results of all functions:  

@image html ocaf_functionmechanism_wp_image005.png "A graph of dependencies between functions"
@image latex ocaf_functionmechanism_wp_image005.png "A graph of dependencies between functions"

  Computation of the model starts with the cone function, then the long cylinder, 
  after that the header cylinder and, finally, the result is generated  by the nail function at the end of function chain.  

  The Function Mechanism of Open CASCADE Technology creates this  graph of dependencies 
  and allows iterating it following the dependencies. 
  The  only thing the Function Mechanism requires from its user 
  is the implementation  of pure virtual methods of *TFunction_Driver*:  
  
  * <i>\::Arguments()</i> -- returns a list of arguments for the  function  
  * <i>\::Results()</i> -- returns a list of results of the function  
  
  These methods give the Function Mechanism the information on the location of arguments 
  and results of the function and allow building a  graph of functions. 
  The class *TFunction_Iterator* iterates the functions of the graph in the execution order.  
  
  The pure virtual method *TFunction_Driver::Execute()* calculating the function should be overridden.  
  
  The method <i>\::MustExecute()</i> calls the method <i>\::Arguments()</i>  of the function driver 
  and ideally this information (knowledge of modification  of arguments of the function) is enough
  to make a decision whether the function  should be executed or not. Therefore, this method usually shouldn’t be overridden.  

  The cone and cylinder functions differ only in geometrical construction algorithms. 
  Other parameters are the same (position, radius and height).  
  
  It means that it is possible to create a base class -- function driver for the three functions, 
  and two descendant classes producing:  a cone or a cylinder.  
  
  For the base function driver the methods <i>\::Arguments()</i>  and <i>\::Results()</i> will be overridden. 
  Two descendant function drivers responsible for creation of a cone and a cylinder will override only the method 
<i>\::Execute()</i>. 
  
  The method <i>\::Arguments()</i> of the function driver of the nail returns the results of the functions located under 
it in the tree of leaves.   The method <i>\::Execute()</i> just collects the  results of the functions and makes one
 shape -- a nail. 
  
  This way the data model using the Function Mechanism is  ready for usage.   Do not forget to introduce the function 
drivers for a function  driver table with the help of *TFunction_DriverTable* class.

### Example 1: iteration and execution of functions. 

  This is an example of the code for iteration and execution of functions.  

~~~~{.cpp}

    // The scope of functions is  defined.  
    Handle(TFunction_Scope) scope = TFunction_Scope::Set( anyLabel );  
     
    // The information on  modifications in the model is received.  
    TFunction_Logbook&amp; log = scope-GetLogbook();  
     
    // The iterator is iInitialized by  the scope of functions.  
    TFunction_Iterator iterator( anyLabel );  
    Iterator.SetUsageOfExecutionOrder( true );  
     
    // The function is iterated,  its  dependency is checked on the modified data and  executed if necessary.  
    for (; iterator.more(); iterator.Next())  
    {  
      // The function iterator may return a list of  current functions for execution.  
      // It might be useful for multi-threaded execution  of functions.  
      const  TDF_LabelList&amp; currentFunctions = iterator.Current();  
       
      //The list of current functions is iterated.  
      TDF_ListIteratorOfLabelList  currentterator( currentFunctions );
      for (;  currentIterator.More(); currentIterator.Next())  
      {  
        //  An interface for the function is created.  
        TFunction_IFunction  interface( currentIterator.Value() );  
     
        //  The function driver is retrieved.  
        Handle(TFunction_Driver)  driver = interface.GetDriver();  
     
        //  The dependency of the function on the  modified data is checked.  
        If  (driver-MustExecute( log ))  
        {  
          // The function is executed.  
          int  ret = driver-Execute( log );  
          if ( ret ) 
            return  false;  
        } // end if check on modification  
      } // end of iteration of current functions  
    } // end of iteration of  functions.

### Example 2: Cylinder function driver

  This is an example of the code for a cylinder function driver. To make the things clearer, the methods 
<i>\::Arguments()</i>  and <i>\::Results()</i>  from the base class are also mentioned.   

~~~~{.cpp}

    // A virtual method  ::Arguments() returns a list of arguments of the function.  
    CylinderDriver::Arguments( TDF_LabelList&amp; args )  
    {  
      // The direct arguments, located at sub-leaves of  the function, are collected (see picture 2).
      TDF_ChildIterator  cIterator( Label(), false );  
      for (;  cIterator.More(); cIterator.Next() )  
      {  
        // Direct argument.  
        TDF_Label  sublabel = cIterator.Value();  
        Args.Append(  sublabel );  

        // The references to the external data are  checked.  
        Handle(TDF_Reference)  ref;  
        If (  sublabel.FindAttribute( TDF_Reference::GetID(), ref ) )  
        {  
          args.Append(  ref-Get() );  
        }
    }
     
    // A virtual method ::Results()  returns a list of result leaves.  
    CylinderDriver::Results( TDF_LabelList&amp; res )  
    {  
      // The result is kept at the function  label.  
      Res.Append(  Label() );  
    }
     
    // Execution of the function  driver.  
    Int CylinderDriver::Execute( TFunction_Logbook&amp; log )  
    {  
      // Position of the cylinder - position of the first  function (cone)   
      //is  elevated along Z for height values of all  previous functions.  
      gp_Ax2 axes = …. // out of the scope of this guide.  
      // The radius value is retrieved.  
      // It is located at second child sub-leaf (see the  picture 2).  
      TDF_Label radiusLabel  = Label().FindChild( 2 );  
       
      // The multiplicator of the radius ()is retrieved.  
      Handle(TDataStd_Real)  radiusValue;  
      radiusLabel.FindAttribute(  TDataStd_Real::GetID(), radiusValue);  
       
      // The reference to the radius is retrieved.  
      Handle(TDF_Reference)  refRadius;  
      RadiusLabel.FindAttribute(  TDF_Reference::GetID(), refRadius );  
       
      // The radius value is calculated.  
      double radius = 0.0;
      
      if (  refRadius.IsNull() )
      {
        radius  = radiusValue-Get();  
      }
      else  
      {  
        // The referenced radius value is  retrieved.   
        Handle(TDataStd_Real)  referencedRadiusValue;  
        RefRadius-Get().FindAttribute(TDataStd_Real::GetID()  ,referencedRadiusValue );  
        radius  = referencedRadiusValue-Get() * radiusValue-Get();  
      }  
       
      // The height value is retrieved.  
      double height = … // similar code to taking the radius value.  
       
      // The cylinder is created.  
      TopoDS_Shape cylinder  = BRepPrimAPI_MakeCylinder(axes, radius, height);  
       
      // The result (cylinder) is set  
      TNaming_Builder  builder( Label() );  
      Builder.Generated(  cylinder );  
       
      // The modification of the result leaf is saved in  the log.  
      log.SetImpacted(  Label() );  
       
      return 0;
    }
