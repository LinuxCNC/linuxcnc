@section occt_draw_1 Introduction

This manual explains how to use Draw, the test harness for Open CASCADE Technology (**OCCT**).
Draw is a command interpreter based on TCL and a graphical system used to test and demonstrate Open CASCADE Technology modeling libraries. 

@subsection occt_draw_1_1 Overview

Draw is a test harness for Open CASCADE Technology. It provides a flexible and easy to use means of testing and demonstrating the OCCT modeling libraries. 

Draw can be used interactively to create, display and modify objects such as curves, surfaces and topological shapes. 

Scripts may be written to customize Draw and perform tests.
New types of objects and new commands may be added using the C++ programming language.

Draw consists of: 

  * A command interpreter based on the TCL command language.
  * A 3d graphic viewer based on the X system.
  * A basic set of commands covering scripts, variables and graphics.
  * A set of geometric commands allowing the user to create and modify curves and surfaces and to use OCCT geometry algorithms. This set of commands is optional.
  * A set of topological commands allowing the user to create and modify BRep shapes and to use the OCCT topology algorithms.


There is also a set of commands for each delivery unit in the modeling libraries: 

  * GEOMETRY, 
  * TOPOLOGY, 
  * ADVALGOS, 
  * GRAPHIC, 
  * PRESENTATION.

This document is a reference manual. It contains a full description of each command. All descriptions have the format illustrated below for the exit command. 

~~~~{.php}
exit
~~~~

Terminates the Draw, TCL session. If the commands are read from a file using the source command, this will terminate the file. 

**Example:** 

~~~~{.php}
# this is a very short example 
exit 
~~~~


@subsection occt_draw_1_3 Getting started

Install Draw and launch Emacs. Get a command line in Emacs using *Esc x* and key in *woksh*. 

All DRAW Test Harness can be activated in the common executable called **DRAWEXE**. They are grouped in toolkits and can be loaded at run-time thereby implementing dynamically loaded plug-ins. Thus, it is possible to work only with the required commands adding them dynamically without leaving the Test Harness session. 

Declaration of available plug-ins is done through the special resource file(s). The *pload* command loads the plug-in in accordance with the specified resource file and activates the commands implemented in the plug-in. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_1_3_1 Launching DRAW Test Harness

Test Harness executable *DRAWEXE* is located in the <i>$CASROOT/\<platform\>/bin</i> directory (where \<platform\> is Win for Windows and Linux for Linux operating systems). Prior to launching it is important to make sure that the environment is correctly setup (usually this is done automatically after the installation process on Windows or after launching specific scripts on Linux).  


@subsubsection occt_draw_1_3_2 Plug-in resource file

Open CASCADE Technology is shipped with the DrawPlugin resource file located in the <i>$CASROOT/src/DrawResources</i> directory. 

The format of the file is compliant with standard Open CASCADE Technology resource files (see the *Resource_Manager.hxx* file for details). 

Each key defines a sequence of either further (nested) keys or a name of the dynamic library. Keys can be nested down to an arbitrary level. However, cyclic dependencies between the keys are not checked. 

**Example:** (excerpt from DrawPlugin): 
~~~~
OCAF               : VISUALIZATION, OCAFKERNEL 
VISUALIZATION      : AISV 
OCAFKERNEL         : DCAF 

DCAF               : TKDCAF 
AISV               : TKViewerTest 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_1_3_3 Activation of commands implemented in the plug-in

To load a plug-in declared in the resource file and to activate the commands the following command must be used in Test Harness: 

~~~~{.php}
pload [-PluginFileName] [[Key1] [Key2]...]
~~~~

Where: 

* <i>-PluginFileName</i> -- defines the name of a plug-in resource file (prefix "-" is mandatory) described above. If this parameter is omitted then the default name *DrawPlugin* is used. 
* *Key* -- defines the key(s) enumerating plug-ins to be loaded. If no keys are specified then the key named *DEFAULT* is used (if there is no such key in the file then no plug-ins are loaded). 

According to the OCCT resource file management rules, to access the resource file the environment variable *CSF_PluginFileNameDefaults* (and optionally *CSF_PluginFileNameUserDefaults*) must be set and point to the directory storing the resource file. If it is omitted then the plug-in resource file will be searched in the <i>$CASROOT/src/DrawResources</i> directory. 

~~~~{.php}
Draw[]        pload -DrawPlugin OCAF 
~~~~
This command will search the resource file *DrawPlugin* using variable *CSF_DrawPluginDefaults* (and *CSF_DrawPluginUserDefaults*) and will start with the OCAF key. Since the *DrawPlugin* is the file shipped with Open CASCADE Technology it will be found in the <i>$CASROOT/src/DrawResources</i> directory (unless this location is redefined by user's variables). The OCAF key will be recursively extracted into two toolkits/plug-ins: *TKDCAF* and *TKViewerTest* (e.g. on Windows they correspond to *TKDCAF.dll* and *TKViewerTest.dll*). Thus, commands implemented for Visualization and OCAF will be loaded and activated in Test Harness. 

~~~~{.php}
Draw[]        pload (equivalent to pload -DrawPlugin DEFAULT). 
~~~~
This command will find the default DrawPlugin file and the DEFAULT key. The latter finally maps to the TKTopTest toolkit which implements basic modeling commands. 


@section occt_draw_2 The Command Language

@subsection occt_draw_2_1 Overview

The command language used in Draw is Tcl. Tcl documentation such as "TCL and the TK Toolkit" by John K. Ousterhout (Addison-Wesley) will prove useful if you intend to use Draw extensively. 

This chapter is designed to give you a short outline of both the TCL language and some extensions included in Draw. The following topics are covered: 

  * Syntax of the TCL language.
  * Accessing variables in TCL and Draw.
  * Control structures.
  * Procedures.

@subsection occt_draw_2_2 Syntax of TCL

TCL is an interpreted command language, not a structured language like C, Pascal, LISP or Basic. It uses a shell similar to that of csh. TCL is, however, easier to use than csh because control structures and procedures are easier to define. As well, because TCL does not assign a process to each command, it is faster than csh. 

The basic program for TCL is a script. A script consists of one or more commands. Commands are separated by new lines or semicolons. 

~~~~{.php}
set a 24 
set b 15 
set a 25; set b 15 
~~~~

Each command consists of one or more *words*; the first word is the name of a command and additional words are arguments to that command. 

Words are separated by spaces or tabs. In the preceding example each of the four commands has three words. A command may contain any number of words and each word is a string of arbitrary length. 

The evaluation of a command by TCL is done in two steps. In the first step, the command is parsed and broken into words. Some substitutions are also performed. In the second step, the command procedure corresponding to the first word is called and the other words are interpreted as arguments. In the first step, there is only string manipulation, The words only acquire *meaning* in the second step by the command procedure. 

The following substitutions are performed by TCL: 

Variable substitution is triggered by the $ character (as with csh), the content of the variable is substituted; { } may be used as in csh to enclose the name of the variable.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# set a variable value 
set file documentation 
puts $file #to display file contents on the screen 

# a simple substitution, set psfile to documentation.ps 
set psfile $file.ps 
puts $psfile 

# another substitution, set pfile to documentationPS 
set pfile ${file}PS 

# a last one, 
# delete files NEWdocumentation and OLDdocumentation 
foreach prefix {NEW OLD} {rm $prefix$file} 
~~~~

Command substitution is triggered by the [ ] characters. The brackets must enclose a valid script. The script is evaluated and the result is substituted. 

Compare command construction in csh. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
set degree 30 
set pi 3.14159265 
# expr is a command evaluating a numeric expression 
set radian [expr $pi*$degree/180] 
~~~~

Backslash substitution is triggered by the backslash character. It is used to insert special characters like $, [ , ] , etc. It is also useful to insert a new line, a backslash terminated line is continued on the following line. 

TCL uses two forms of *quoting* to prevent substitution and word breaking. 

Double quote *quoting* enables the definition of a string with space and tabs as a single word. Substitutions are still performed inside the inverted commas " ". 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# set msg to ;the price is 12.00; 
set price 12.00 
set msg ;the price is $price; 
~~~~

Braces *quoting* prevents all substitutions. Braces are also nested. The main use of braces is to defer evaluation when defining procedures and control structures. Braces are used for a clearer presentation of TCL scripts on several lines. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
set x 0 
# this will loop for ever 
# because while argument is ;0 < 3; 
while ;$x < 3; {set x [expr $x+1]} 
# this will terminate as expected because 
# while argument is {$x < 3} 
while {$x < 3} {set x [expr $x+1]} 
# this can be written also 
while {$x < 3} { 
set x [expr $x+1] 
} 
# the following cannot be written 
# because while requires two arguments 
while {$x < 3} 
{ 
set x [expr $x+1] 
} 
~~~~

Comments start with a \# character as the first non-blank character in a command. To add a comment at the end of the line, the comment must be preceded by a semi-colon to end the preceding command. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# This is a comment 
set a 1 # this is not a comment 
set b 1; # this is a comment 
~~~~

The number of words is never changed by substitution when parsing in TCL. For example, the result of a substitution is always a single word. This is different from csh but convenient as the behavior of the parser is more predictable. It may sometimes be necessary to force a second round of parsing. **eval** accomplishes this: it accepts several arguments, concatenates them and executes the resulting script. 


**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# I want to delete two files 

set files ;foo bar; 

# this will fail because rm will receive only one argument 
# and complain that ;foo bar; does not exit 

exec rm $files 

# a second evaluation will do it 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_2_3 Accessing variables in TCL and Draw

TCL variables have only string values. Note that even numeric values are stored as string literals, and computations using the **expr** command start by parsing the strings. Draw, however, requires variables with other kinds of values such as curves, surfaces or topological shapes. 

TCL provides a mechanism to link user data to variables. Using this functionality, Draw defines its variables as TCL variables with associated data. 

The string value of a Draw variable is meaningless. It is usually set to the name of the variable itself. Consequently, preceding a Draw variable with a <i>$</i> does not change the result of a command. The content of a Draw variable is accessed using appropriate commands. 

There are many kinds of Draw variables, and new ones may be added with C++. Geometric and topological variables are described below. 

Draw numeric variables can be used within an expression anywhere a Draw command requires a numeric value. The *expr* command is useless in this case as the variables are stored not as strings but as floating point values. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# dset is used for numeric variables 
# pi is a predefined Draw variable 
dset angle pi/3 radius 10 
point p radius*cos(angle) radius*sin(angle) 0 
~~~~
It is recommended that you use TCL variables only for strings and Draw for numerals. That way, you will avoid the *expr* command. As a rule, Geometry and Topology require numbers but no strings. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_2_3_1 set, unset

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
set varname [value] 
unset varname [varname varname ...] 
~~~~

*set* assigns a string value to a variable. If the variable does not already exist, it is created. 

Without a value, *set* returns the content of the variable. 

*unset* deletes variables. It is also used to delete Draw variables.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
set a "Hello world"
set b "Goodbye" 
set a 
== "Hello world" 
unset a b 
set a 
~~~~

**Note**, that the *set* command can set only one variable, unlike the *dset* command. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_2_3_2 dset, dval

Syntax

~~~~{.php}
dset var1 value1 vr2 value2 ... 
dval name 
~~~~

*dset* assigns values to Draw numeric variables. The argument can be any numeric expression including Draw numeric variables. Since all Draw commands expect a numeric expression, there is no need to use $ or *expr*. The *dset* command can assign several variables. If there is an odd number of arguments, the last variable will be assigned a value of 0. If the variable does not exist, it will be created. 

*dval* evaluates an expression containing Draw numeric variables and returns the result as a string, even in the case of a single variable. This is not used in Draw commands as these usually interpret the expression. It is used for basic TCL commands expecting strings. 


**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# z is set to 0 
dset x 10 y 15 z 
== 0 

# no $ required for Draw commands 
point p x y z 

# "puts" prints a string 
puts ;x = [dval x], cos(x/pi) = [dval cos(x/pi)]; 
== x = 10, cos(x/pi) = -0.99913874099467914 
~~~~

**Note,** that in TCL, parentheses are not considered to be special characters. Do not forget to quote an expression if it contains spaces in order to avoid parsing different words. <i>(a + b)</i> is parsed as three words: <i>"(a + b)"</i> or <i>(a+b)</i> are correct.

@subsubsection occt_draw_2_3_3 del, dall

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
del varname_pattern [varname_pattern ...] 
dall
~~~~

*del* command does the same thing as *unset*, but it deletes the variables matched by the pattern.

*dall* command deletes all variables in the session.

@subsection occt_draw_2_4 lists

TCL uses lists. A list is a string containing elements separated by spaces or tabs. If the string contains braces, the braced part accounts as one element. 

This allows you to insert lists within lists. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a list of 3 strings 
;a b c; 

# a list of two strings the first is a list of 2 
;{a b} c; 
~~~~

Many TCL commands return lists and **foreach** is a useful way to create loops on list elements. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_2_5 Control Structures

TCL allows looping using control structures. The control structures are implemented by commands and their syntax is very similar to that of their C counterparts (**if**, **while**, **switch**, etc.). In this case, there are two main differences between TCL and C: 

* You use braces instead of parentheses to enclose conditions. 
* You do not start the script on the next line of your command. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_2_5_1 if

Syntax       

~~~~{.php}
if condition script [elseif script .... else script] 
~~~~

**If** evaluates the condition and the script to see whether the condition is true. 



**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
if {$x > 0} { 
puts ;positive; 
} elseif {$x == 0} { 
puts ;null; 
} else { 
puts ;negative; 
} 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_2_5_2 while, for, foreach

Syntax:


~~~~{.php}
while condition script 
for init condition reinit script 
foreach varname list script 
~~~~

The three loop structures are similar to their C or csh equivalent. It is important to use braces to delay evaluation. **foreach** will assign the elements of the list to the variable before evaluating the script. \

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# while example 
dset x 1.1 
while {[dval x] < 100} { 
  circle c 0 0 x 
  dset x x*x 
} 
# for example 
# incr var d, increments a variable of d (default 1) 
for {set i 0} {$i < 10} {incr i} { 
  dset angle $i*pi/10 
  point p$i cos(angle0 sin(angle) 0 
} 
# foreach example 
foreach object {crapo tomson lucas} {display $object} 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_2_5_3 break, continue

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
break 
continue 
~~~~

Within loops, the **break** and **continue** commands have the same effect as in C. 

**break** interrupts the innermost loop and **continue** jumps to the next iteration. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# search the index for which t$i has value ;secret; 
for {set i 1} {$i <= 100} {incr i} { 
  if {[set t$i] == ;secret;} break; 
} 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_2_6 Procedures

TCL can be extended by defining procedures using the **proc** command, which sets up a context of local variables, binds arguments and executes a TCL script. 

The only problematic aspect of procedures is that variables are strictly local, and as they are implicitly created when used, it may be difficult to detect errors. 

There are two means of accessing a variable outside the scope of the current procedures: **global** declares a global variable (a variable outside all procedures); **upvar** accesses a variable in the scope of the caller. Since arguments in TCL are always string values, the only way to pass Draw variables is by reference, i.e. passing the name of the variable and using the **upvar** command as in the following examples. 

As TCL is not a strongly typed language it is very difficult to detect programming errors and debugging can be tedious. TCL procedures are, of course, not designed for large scale software development but for testing and simple command or interactive writing. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_2_6_1 proc

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
proc argumentlist script 
~~~~

**proc** defines a procedure. An argument may have a default value. It is then a list of the form {argument value}. The script is the body of the procedure. 

**return** gives a return value to the procedure. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# simple procedure 
proc hello {} { 
  puts ;hello world; 
} 
# procedure with arguments and default values 
proc distance {x1 y1 {x2 0} {y2 0}} { 
  set d [expr (x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1)] 
  return [expr sqrt(d)] 
} 
proc fact n { 
  if {$n == 0} {return 1} else { 
    return [expr n*[fact [expr n -1]]] 
  } 
} 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_2_6_2 global, upvar

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
global varname [varname ...] 
upvar varname localname [varname localname ...] 
~~~~


**global** accesses high level variables. Unlike C, global variables are not visible in procedures. 

**upvar** gives a local name to a variable in the caller scope. This is useful when an argument is the name of a variable instead of a value. This is a call by reference and is the only way to use Draw variables as arguments. 

**Note** that in the following examples the \$ character is always necessarily used to access the arguments.
 
**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# convert degree to radian 
# pi is a global variable 
proc deg2rad (degree} { 
  return [dval pi*$degree/2.] 
} 
# create line with a point and an angle 
proc linang {linename x y angle} { 
  upvar linename l 
  line l $x $y cos($angle) sin($angle) 
}
~~~~

@section occt_draw_3 Basic Commands

This chapter describes all the commands defined in the basic Draw package. Some are TCL commands, but most of them have been formulated in Draw. These commands are found in all Draw applications. The commands are grouped into four sections: 

  * General commands, which are used for Draw and TCL management.
  * Variable commands, which are used to manage Draw variables such as storing and dumping.
  * Graphic commands, which are used to manage the graphic system, and so pertain to views.
  * Variable display commands, which are used to manage the display of objects within given views.

Note that Draw also features a GUI task bar providing an alternative way to give certain general, graphic and display commands 


@subsection occt_draw_3_1 General commands

This section describes several useful commands:

  * **help** to get information, 
  * **source** to eval a script from a file, 
  * **spy** to capture the commands in a file,
  * **cpulimit** to limit the process cpu time, 
  * **wait** to waste some time, 
  * **chrono** to time commands. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_3_1_1 help

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
help [command [helpstring group]] 
~~~~

Provides help or modifies the help information. 

**help** without arguments lists all groups and the commands in each group. 

Specifying the command returns its syntax and in some cases, information on the command, The joker \* is automatically added at the end so that all completing commands are returned as well. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# Gives help on all commands starting with *a* 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_3_1_2 source

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
source filename 
~~~~
Executes a file. 

The **exit** command will terminate the file. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_3_1_3 spy

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
spy [filename] 
~~~~

Saves interactive commands in the file. If spying has already been performed, the current file is closed. **spy** without an argument closes the current file and stops spying. If a file already exists, the file is overwritten. Commands are not appended. 

If a command returns an error it is saved with a comment mark. 

The file created by **spy** can be executed with the **source** command. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# all commands will be saved in the file ;session; 
spy session 
# the file ;session; is closed and commands are not saved 
spy 
~~~~



@subsubsection occt_draw_3_1_4 cpulimit

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
cpulimit [nbseconds] 
~~~~

**cpulimit**limits a process after the number of seconds specified in nbseconds. It is used in tests to avoid infinite loops. **cpulimit** without arguments removes all existing limits. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
#limit cpu to one hour 
cpulimit 3600 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_3_1_5 wait

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
wait [nbseconds] 
~~~~
Suspends execution for the number of seconds specified in *nbseconds*. The default value is ten (10) seconds. This is a useful command for a slide show. 

~~~~{.php}
# You have ten seconds ... 
wait 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_3_1_6 chrono

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
chrono [ name start/stop/reset/show/restart/[counter text]]
~~~~

Without arguments, **chrono** activates Draw chronometers. The elapsed time ,cpu system and cpu user times for each command will be printed. 

With arguments, **chrono** is used to manage activated chronometers. You can perform the following actions with a chronometer. 
  * run the chronometer (start).
  * stop the chronometer (stop).
  * reset the chronometer to 0 (reset).
  * restart the chronometer (restart).
  * display the current time (show).
  * display the current time with specified text (output example - *COUNTER text: N*), command <i>testdiff</i> will compare such outputs between two test runs (counter).

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
chrono 
==Chronometers activated. 
ptorus t 20 5 
==Elapsed time: 0 Hours 0 Minutes 0.0318 Seconds 
==CPU user time: 0.01 seconds 
==CPU system time: 0 seconds 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_3_2  Variable management commands

@subsubsection occt_draw_3_2_1 isdraw, directory

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
isdraw varname 
directory [pattern] 
~~~~

**isdraw** tests to see if a variable is a Draw variable. **isdraw** will return 1 if there is a Draw value attached to the variable. 

Use **directory** to return a list of all Draw global variables matching a pattern. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
set a 1 
isdraw a 
=== 0 

dset a 1 
isdraw a 
=== 1 

circle c 0 0 1 0 5 
isdraw c 
=== 1 

# to destroy all Draw objects with name containing curve 
foreach var [directory *curve*] {unset $var} 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_3_2_2 whatis, dump

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
whatis varname [varname ...] 
dump varname [varname ...] 
~~~~

**whatis** returns short information about a Draw variable. This is usually the type name. 

**dump** returns a brief type description, the coordinates, and if need be, the parameters of a Draw variable. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
circle c 0 0 1 0 5 
whatis c 
c is a 2d curve 

dump c 

***** Dump of c ***** 
Circle 
Center :0, 0 
XAxis :1, 0 
YAxis :-0, 1 
Radius :5 
~~~~

**Note** The behavior of *whatis* on other variables (not Draw) is not excellent. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_3_2_3 renamevar, copy

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
renamevar varname tovarname [varname tovarname ...] 
copy varname tovarname [varname tovarname ...] 
~~~~

  * **renamevar** changes the name of a Draw variable. The original variable will no longer exist. Note that the content is not modified. Only the name is changed. 
  * **copy** creates a new variable with a copy of the content of an existing variable. The exact behavior of **copy** is type dependent; in the case of certain topological variables, the content may still be shared. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
circle c1 0 0 1 0 5 
renamevar c1 c2 

# curves are copied, c2 will not be modified 
copy c2 c3 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_3_2_4 datadir, save, restore

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
datadir [directory] 
save variable [filename] 
restore filename [variablename] 
~~~~

  * **datadir** without arguments prints the path of the current data directory. 
  * **datadir** with an argument sets the data directory path. \

If the path starts with a dot (.) only the last directory name will be changed in the path. 

  * **save** writes a file in the data directory with the content of a variable. By default the name of the file is the name of the variable. To give a different name use a second argument. 
  * **restore** reads the content of a file in the data directory in a local variable. By default, the name of the variable is the name of the file. To give a different name, use a second argument. 

The exact content of the file is type-dependent. They are usually ASCII files and so, architecture independent. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# note how TCL accesses shell environment variables 
# using $env() 
datadir 
==. 

datadir $env(WBCONTAINER)/data/default 
==/adv_20/BAG/data/default 

box b 10 20 30 
save b theBox 
==/adv_20/BAG/data/default/theBox 

# when TCL does not find a command it tries a shell command 
ls [datadir] 
== theBox 

restore theBox 
== theBox 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_3_3 User defined commands

*DrawTrSurf* provides commands to create and display a Draw **geometric** variable from a *Geom_Geometry* object and also get a *Geom_Geometry* object from a Draw geometric variable name. 

*DBRep* provides commands to create and display a Draw **topological** variable from a *TopoDS_Shape* object and also get a *TopoDS_Shape* object from a Draw topological variable name.

@section occt_draw_4 Graphic Commands

Graphic commands are used to manage the Draw graphic system. Draw provides a 2d and a 3d viewer with up to 30 views. Views are numbered and the index of the view is displayed in the window’s title. Objects are displayed in all 2d views or in all 3d views, depending on their type. 2d objects can only be viewed in 2d views while 3d objects -- only in 3d views correspondingly. 

@subsection occt_draw_4_1 Axonometric viewer

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_1 view, delete

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
view index type [X Y W H] 
delete [index] 
~~~~

**view** is the basic view creation command: it creates a new view with the given index. If a view with this index already exits, it is deleted. The view is created with default parameters and X Y W H are the position and dimensions of the window on the screen. Default values are 0, 0, 500, 500. 

As a rule it is far simpler either to use the procedures **axo**, **top**, **left** or to click on the desired view type in the menu under *Views* in the task bar.. 

**delete** deletes a view. If no index is given, all the views are deleted. 

Type selects from the following range: 

  * *AXON* : Axonometric view
  * *PERS* : Perspective view
  * <i>+X+Y</i> : View on both axes (i.e. a top view), other codes are <i>-X+Y</i>, <i>+Y-Z</i>, etc.
  * <i>-2D-</i> : 2d view

The index, the type, the current zoom are displayed in the window title . 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# this is the content of the mu4 procedure 
proc mu4 {} { 
delete 
view 1 +X+Z 320 20 400 400 
view 2 +X+Y 320 450 400 400 
view 3 +Y+Z 728 20 400 400 
view 4 AXON 728 450 400 400 
} 
~~~~

See also: **axo, pers, top, bottom, left, right, front, back, mu4, v2d, av2d, smallview** 

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_2  axo, pers, top, ...

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
axo 
pers 
... 
smallview type 
~~~~

All these commands are procedures used to define standard screen layout. They delete all existing views and create new ones. The layout usually complies with the European convention, i.e. a top view is under a front view. 

  * **axo** creates a large window axonometric view;
  * **pers** creates a large window perspective view;
  * **top**, **bottom**, **left**, **right**, **front**, **back** create a large window axis view;
  * **mu4** creates four small window views: front, left, top and axo.
  * **v2d** creates a large window 2d view.
  * **av2d** creates two small window views, one 2d and one axo
  * **smallview** creates a view at the bottom right of the screen of the given type. 

See also: **view**, **delete** 

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_3 mu, md, 2dmu, 2dmd, zoom, 2dzoom

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
    mu [index] value 
    2dmu [index] value 
    zoom [index] value 
    wzoom 
~~~~

* **mu** (magnify up) increases the zoom in one or several views by a factor of 10%. 
* **md** (magnify down) decreases the zoom by the inverse factor. **2dmu** and **2dmd** 
perform the same on one or all 2d views. 
* **zoom** and **2dzoom** set the zoom factor to a value specified by you. The current zoom factor is always displayed in the window’s title bar. Zoom 20 represents a full screen view in a large window; zoom 10, a full screen view in a small one. 
* **wzoom** (window zoom) allows you to select the area you want to zoom in on with the mouse. You will be prompted to give two of the corners of the area that you want to magnify and the rectangle so defined will occupy the window of the view. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
    # set a zoom of 2.5 
    zoom 2.5 

    # magnify by 10% 
    mu 1 

    # magnify by 20% 
~~~~
See also: **fit**, **2dfit** 


@subsubsection occt_draw_4_14 pu, pd, pl, pr, 2dpu, 2dpd, 2dpl, 2dpr

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
pu [index] 
pd [index] 
~~~~

The <i>p_</i> commands are used to pan. **pu** and **pd** pan up and down respectively; **pl** and **pr** pan to the left and to the right respectively. Each time the view is displaced by 40 pixels. When no index is given, all views will pan in the direction specified. 
~~~~{.php}
# you have selected one anonometric view
pu
# or
pu 1

# you have selected an mu4 view; the object in the third view will pan up
pu 3
~~~~
See also: **fit**, **2dfit** 


@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_5 fit, 2dfit

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
fit [index] 
2dfit [index] 
~~~~

**fit** computes the best zoom and pans on the content of the view. The content of the view will be centered and fit the whole window. 

When fitting all views a unique zoom is computed for all the views. All views are on the same scale. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# fit only view 1 
fit 1 
# fit all 2d views 
2dfit 
~~~~
See also: **zoom**, **mu**, **pu** 


@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_6 u, d, l, r

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
u [index] 
d [index] 
l [index] 
r [index] 
~~~~

**u**, **d**, **l**, **r** Rotate the object in view around its axis by five degrees up, down, left or right respectively. This command is restricted to axonometric and perspective views. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# rotate the view up 
u 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_7 focal, fu, fd

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
focal [f] 
fu [index] 
fd [index] 
~~~~

* **focal** changes the vantage point in perspective views. A low f value increases the perspective effect; a high one give a perspective similar to that of an axonometric view. The default value is 500. 
* **fu** and **fd** increase or decrease the focal value by 10%. **fd** makes the eye closer to the object. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
pers 
repeat 10 fd 
~~~~

**Note**: Do not use a negative or null focal value. 

See also: **pers** 

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_8 color

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
color index name 
~~~~

**color** sets the color to a value. The index of the *color* is a value between 0 and 15. The name is an X window color name. The list of these can be found in the file *rgb.txt* in the X library directory. 

The default values are: 0 White, 1 Red, 2 Green, 3 Blue, 4 Cyan, 5 Gold, 6 Magenta, 7 Marron, 8 Orange, 9 Pink, 10 Salmon, 11 Violet, 12 Yellow, 13 Khaki, 14 Coral. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# change the value of blue 
color 3 "navy blue" 
~~~~


**Note** that the color change will be visible on the next redraw of the views, for example, after *fit* or *mu*, etc. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_9 dtext

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
dtext [x y [z]] string 
~~~~

**dtext** displays a string in all 3d or 2d views. If no coordinates are given, a graphic selection is required. If two coordinates are given, the text is created in a 2d view at the position specified. With 3 coordinates, the text is created in a 3d view. 

The coordinates are real space coordinates. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# mark the origins 
dtext 0 0 bebop 
dtext 0 0 0 bebop 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_10 hardcopy, hcolor, xwd

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
hardcopy [index] 
hcolor index width gray 
xwd [index] filename 
~~~~

* **hardcopy** creates a postcript file called a4.ps in the current directory. This file contains the postscript description of the view index, and will allow you to print the view. 
* **hcolor** lets you change the aspect of lines in the postscript file. It allows to specify a width and a gray level for one of the 16 colors. **width** is measured in points with default value as 1, **gray** is the gray level from 0 = black to 1 = white with default value as 0. All colors are bound to the default values at the beginning. 
* **xwd** creates an X window xwd file from an active view. By default, the index is set to1. To visualize an xwd file, use the unix command **xwud**. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# all blue lines (color 3) 
# will be half-width and gray 
hcolor 3 0.5 

# make a postscript file and print it 
hardcopy 
lpr a4.ps 

# make an xwd file and display it 
xwd theview 
xwud -in theview 
~~~~

**Note:** When more than one view is present, specify the index of the view. 

Only use a postscript printer to print postscript files. 

See also: **color** 


@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_11 wclick, pick

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
wclick 
pick index X Y Z b [nowait] 
~~~~

**wclick** defers an event until the mouse button is clicked. The message <code>just click</code> is displayed. 

Use the **pick** command to get graphic input. The arguments must be names for variables where the results are stored. 
  * index: index of the view where the input was made.
  * X,Y,Z: 3d coordinates in real world.
  * b: b is the mouse button 1,2 or 3.

When there is an extra argument, its value is not used and the command does not wait for a click; the value of b may then be 0 if there has not been a click. 

This option is useful for tracking the pointer. 

**Note** that the results are stored in Draw numeric variables.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# make a circle at mouse location 
pick index x y z b 
circle c x y z 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 30 

# make a dynamic circle at mouse location 
# stop when a button is clicked 
# (see the repaint command) 

dset b 0 
while {[dval b] == 0} { 
pick index x y z b nowait 
circle c x y z 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 30 
repaint 
} 
~~~~
See also: **repaint** 


Draw provides commands to manage the display of objects. 
* **display**, **donly** are used to display, 
* **erase**, **clear**, **2dclear** to erase. 
* **autodisplay** command is used to check whether variables are displayed when created. 

The variable name "." (dot) has a special status in Draw. Any Draw command expecting a Draw object as argument can be passed a dot. The meaning of the dot is the following. 
  * If the dot is an input argument, a graphic selection will be made. Instead of getting the object from a variable, Draw will ask you to select an object in a view.
  * If the dot is an output argument, an unnamed object will be created. Of course this makes sense only for graphic objects: if you create an unnamed number you will not be able to access it. This feature is used when you want to create objects for display only.
  * If you do not see what you expected while executing loops or sourcing files, use the **repaint** and **dflush** commands.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# OK use dot to dump an object on the screen 
dump . 

point . x y z 

#Not OK. display points on a curve c 
# with dot no variables are created 
for {set i 0} {$i <= 10} {incr i} { 
cvalue c $i/10 x y z 
point . x y z 
} 

# point p x y z 
# would have displayed only one point 
# because the precedent variable content is erased 

# point p$i x y z 
# is an other solution, creating variables 
# p0, p1, p2, .... 

# give a name to a graphic object 
renamevar . x 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_12 autodisplay

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
autodisplay [0/1] 
~~~~

By default, Draw automatically displays any graphic object as soon as it is created. This behavior known as autodisplay can be removed with the command **autodisplay**. Without arguments, **autodisplay** toggles the autodisplay mode. The command always returns the current mode. 

When **autodisplay** is off, using the dot return argument is ineffective. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# c is displayed 
circle c 0 0 1 0 5 

# toggle the mode 
autodisplay 
== 0 
circle c 0 0 1 0 5 

# c is erased, but not displayed 
display c 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_13 display, donly

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
display varname [varname ...] 
donly varname [varname ...] 
~~~~

* **display** makes objects visible. 
* **donly** *display only* makes objects visible and erases all other objects. It is very useful to extract one object from a messy screen. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
\# to see all objects 
foreach var [directory] {display $var} 

\# to select two objects and erase the other ones 
donly . . 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_14 erase, clear, 2dclear

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
erase [varname varname ...] 
clear 
2dclear 
~~~~

**erase** removes objects from all views. **erase** without arguments erases everything in 2d and 3d. 

**clear** erases only 3d objects and **2dclear** only 2d objects. **erase** without arguments is similar to  **clear; 2dclear**.


**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# erase eveerything with a name starting with c_ 
foreach var [directory c_*] {erase $var} 

# clear 2d views 
2dclear 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_14_1 disp, don, era

These commands have the same meaning as correspondingly display, donly and erase, but with the difference that they evaluate the arguments using glob pattern rules.
For example, to display all objects with names d_1, d_2, d_3, etc. it is enough to run the command:
~~~~{.php}
disp d_*
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_4_1_15 repaint, dflush


Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
repaint 
dflush 
~~~~

* **repaint** forces repainting of views. 
* **dflush** flushes the graphic buffers. 

These commands are useful within loops or in scripts. 

When an object is modified or erased, the whole view must be repainted. To avoid doing this too many times, Draw sets up a flag and delays the repaint to the end of the command in which the new prompt is issued. In a script, you may want to display the result of a change immediately. If the flag is raised, **repaint** will repaint the views and clear the flag. 

Graphic operations are buffered by Draw (and also by the X system). Usually the buffer is flushed at the end of a command and before graphic selection. If you want to flush the buffer from inside a script, use the **dflush** command.

@section occt_draw_6 Geometry commands

@subsection occt_draw_6_1 Overview

Draw provides a set of commands to test geometry libraries. These commands are found in the TGEOMETRY executable, or in any Draw executable which includes *GeometryTest* commands. 

In the context of Geometry, Draw includes the following types of variable: 

  * 2d and 3d points
  * The 2d curve, which corresponds to *Curve* in *Geom2d*.
  * The 3d curve and surface, which correspond to *Curve* and *Surface* in <a href="user_guides__modeling_data.html#occt_modat_1">Geom package</a>.
  
Draw geometric variables never share data; the *copy* command will always make a complete copy of the content of the variable. 

The following topics are covered in the nine sections of this chapter: 

  * **Curve creation** deals with the various types of curves and how to create them.
  * **Surface creation** deals with the different types of surfaces and how to create them.
  * **Curve and surface modification** deals with the commands used to modify the definition of curves and surfaces, most of which concern modifications to bezier and bspline curves.
  * **Geometric transformations** covers translation, rotation, mirror image and point scaling transformations.
  * **Curve and Surface Analysis** deals with the commands used to compute points, derivatives and curvatures.
  * **Intersections** presents intersections of surfaces and curves.
  * **Approximations** deals with creating curves and surfaces from a set of points.
  * **Constraints** concerns construction of 2d circles and lines by constraints such as tangency.
  * **Display** describes commands to control the display of curves and surfaces.

Where possible, the commands have been made broad in application, i.e. they apply to 2d curves, 3d curves and surfaces. For instance, the *circle* command may create a 2d or a 3d circle depending on the number of arguments given. 

Likewise, the *translate* command will process points, curves or surfaces, depending on argument type. You may not always find the specific command you are looking for in the section where you expect it to be. In that case, look in another section. The *trim* command, for example, is described in the surface section. It can, nonetheless, be used with curves as well. 

@subsection occt_draw_6_2  Curve creation

This section deals with both points and curves. Types of curves are: 

  * Analytical curves such as lines, circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.
  * Polar curves such as bezier curves and bspline curves.
  * Trimmed curves and offset curves made from other curves with the *trim* and *offset* commands. Because they are used on both curves and surfaces, the *trim* and *offset* commands are described in the *surface creation* section.
  * NURBS can be created from other curves using *convert* in the *Surface Creation* section.
  * Curves can be created from the isoparametric lines of surfaces by the *uiso* and *viso* commands.
  * 3d curves can be created from 2d curves and vice versa using the *to3d* and *to2d* commands. The *project* command computes a 2d curve on a 3d surface.

Curves are displayed with an arrow showing the last parameter. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_1 point

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
point name x y [z] 
~~~~
  
Creates a 2d or 3d point, depending on the number of arguments. 

**Example:**
~~~~{.php}
# 2d point 
point p1 1 2 

# 3d point 
point p2 10 20 -5 
~~~~
  
@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_2  line

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
line name x y [z] dx dy [dz]
~~~~

  
Creates a 2d or 3d line. *x y z* are the coordinates of the line’s point of origin; *dx, dy, dz* give the direction vector. 

A 2d line will be represented as *x y dx dy*, and a 3d line as *x y z dx dy dz* . A line is parameterized along its length starting from the point of origin along the direction vector. The direction vector is normalized and must not be null. Lines are infinite, even though their representation is not. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a 2d line at 45 degrees of the X axis 
line l 2 0 1 1 

# a 3d line through the point 10 0 0 and parallel to Z 
line l 10 0 0 0 0 1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_3  circle

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
circle name x y [z [dx dy dz]] [ux uy [uz]] radius
~~~~

Creates a 2d or a 3d circle. 

In 2d, *x, y* are the coordinates of the center and *ux, uy* define the vector towards the point of origin of the parameters. By default, this direction is (1,0). The X Axis of the local coordinate system defines the origin of the parameters of the circle. Use another vector than the x axis to change the origin of parameters. 

In 3d, *x, y, z* are the coordinates of the center; *dx, dy, dz* give the vector normal to the plane of the circle. By default, this vector is (0,0,1) i.e. the Z axis (it must not be null). *ux, uy, uz* is the direction of the origin; if not given, a default direction will be computed. This vector must neither be null nor parallel to *dx, dy, dz*. 

The circle is parameterized by the angle in [0,2*pi] starting from the origin and. Note that the specification of origin direction and plane is the same for all analytical curves and surfaces. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# A 2d circle of radius 5 centered at 10,-2 
circle c1 10 -2 5 

# another 2d circle with a user defined origin 
# the point of parameter 0 on this circle will be 
# 1+sqrt(2),1+sqrt(2) 
circle c2 1 1 1 1 2 

# a 3d circle, center 10 20 -5, axis Z, radius 17 
circle c3 10 20 -5 17 

# same 3d circle with axis Y 
circle c4 10 20 -5 0 1 0 17 

# full 3d circle, axis X, origin on Z 
circle c5 10 20 -5 1 0 0 0 0 1 17

The axis system is given by *firstradius*, the major radius, and *secondradius*, the minor radius. The parameter range of the ellipse is [0,2.*pi] starting from the X axis and going towards the Y axis. The Draw ellipse is parameterized by an angle: 

~~~~{.php}

~~~~

Creates a 2d or 3d conic. The first arguments define the center. The axis system is given by *firstradius*, the major radius, and *secondradius*, the minor radius. Note that the hyperbola has only one branch, that in the X direction. 

The Draw hyperbola is parameterized as follows:

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_6  parabola

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
parabola name x y [z [dx dy dz]] [ux uy [uz]] FocalLength 
~~~~

Creates a 2d or 3d parabola. in the axis system defined by the first arguments. The origin is the apex of the parabola. 

The *Geom_Parabola* is parameterized as follows: 

~~~~{.php}
P(u) = O + u*u/(4.*F)*XDir + u*YDir 
~~~~

Where: 
  * *P* is the point of parameter *u*,
  * *O, XDir* and *YDir* are respectively the origin, *X Direction* and *Y Direction* of its local coordinate system,

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_7  beziercurve, 2dbeziercurve

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
beziercurve name nbpole pole, [weight] 
2dbeziercurve name nbpole pole, [weight]
~~~~

Creates a 3d rational or non-rational Bezier curve. Give the number of poles (control points,) and the coordinates of the poles *(x1 y1 z1 [w1] x2 y2 z2 [w2])*. The degree will be *nbpoles-1*. To create a rational curve, give weights with the poles. You must give weights for all poles or for none. If the weights of all the poles are equal, the curve is polynomial, and therefore non-rational. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a rational 2d bezier curve (arc of circle) 
2dbeziercurve ci 3 0 0 1 10 0 sqrt(2.)/2. 10 10 1

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_8  bsplinecurve, 2dbsplinecurve, pbsplinecurve, 2dpbsplinecurve

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}

2dbsplinecurve name degree nbknots knot, umult pole, weight

pbsplinecurve   name degree nbknots knot, umult pole, weight (periodic)
2dpbsplinecurve name degree nbknots knot, umult pole, weight (periodic)
~~~~

Creates 2d or 3d bspline curves; the **pbsplinecurve** and **2dpbsplinecurve** commands create periodic bspline curves. 

A bspline curve is defined by its degree, its periodic or non-periodic nature, a table of knots and a table of poles (i.e. control points). Consequently, specify the degree, the number of knots, and for each knot, the multiplicity, for each pole, the weight. In the syntax above, the commas link the adjacent arguments which they fall between: knot and multiplicities, pole and weight. 

The table of knots is an increasing sequence of reals without repetition. 
Multiplicities must be lower or equal to the degree of the curve. For non-periodic curves, the first and last multiplicities can be equal to degree+1. For a periodic curve, the first and last multiplicities must be equal. 

The poles must be given with their weights, use weights of 1 for a non rational curve, the number of poles must be: 

  * For a non periodic curve: Sum of multiplicities - degree + 1
  * For a periodic curve: Sum of multiplicities - last multiplicity

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a bspline curve with 4 poles and 3 knots 
bsplinecurve bc 2 3 0 3 1 1 2 3 \ 
10 0 7 1 7 0 7 1 3 0 8 1 0 0 7 1 
# a 2d periodic circle (parameter from 0 to 2*pi !!) 
dset h sqrt(3)/2 
2dpbsplinecurve c 2 \ 
4 0 2 pi/1.5 2 pi/0.75 2 2*pi 2 \ 
0 -h/3 1 \ 
0.5 -h/3 0.5 \ 
0.25 h/6 1 \ 
0 2*h/3 0.5 \ 
-0.25 h/6 1 \ 
-0.5 -h/3 0.5 \ 
0 -h/3 1 
~~~~

**Note** that you can create the **NURBS** subset of bspline curves and surfaces by trimming analytical curves and surfaces and executing the command *convert*. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_9  uiso, viso

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
uiso name surface u 
viso name surface u 
~~~~

Creates a U or V isoparametric curve from a surface. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create a cylinder and extract iso curves 

cylinder c 10 
uiso c1 c pi/6 
viso c2 c 
~~~~

**Note** that this cannot be done from offset surfaces.


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_10  to3d, to2d

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
to3d name curve2d [plane] 
to2d name curve3d [plane] 
~~~~

Create respectively a 3d curve from a 2d curve and a 2d curve from a 3d curve. The transformation uses a planar surface to define the XY plane in 3d (by default this plane is the default OXYplane). **to3d** always gives a correct result, but as **to2d** is not a projection, it may surprise you. It is always correct if the curve is planar and parallel to the plane of projection. The points defining the curve are projected on the plane. A circle, however, will remain a circle and will not be changed to an ellipse. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# the following commands 
circle c 0 0 5 
plane p -2 1 0 1 2 3 
to3d c c p 

# will create the same circle as 
circle c -2 1 0 1 2 3 5 
~~~~

See also: **project** 


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_2_11  project

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
project name curve3d surface 
~~~~

Computes a 2d curve in the parametric space of a surface corresponding to a 3d curve. This can only be used on analytical surfaces. 

If we, for example, intersect a cylinder and a plane and project the resulting ellipse on the cylinder, this will create a 2d sinusoid-like bspline. 

~~~~{.php}
cylinder c 5 
plane p 0 0 0 0 1 1 
intersect i c p 
project i2d i c 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_6_3  Surface creation

The following types of surfaces exist: 
  * Analytical surfaces: plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus;
  * Polar surfaces: bezier surfaces, bspline surfaces;
  * Trimmed and Offset surfaces;
  * Surfaces produced by Revolution and Extrusion, created from curves with the *revsurf* and *extsurf*;
  * NURBS surfaces.

Surfaces are displayed with isoparametric lines. To show the parameterization, a small parametric line with a length 1/10 of V is displayed at 1/10 of U. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_1  plane

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
plane name [x y z [dx dy dz [ux uy uz]]]
~~~~

Creates an infinite plane. 

A plane is the same as a 3d coordinate system, *x,y,z* is the origin, *dx, dy, dz* is the Z direction and *ux, uy, uz* is the X direction. 

The plane is perpendicular to Z and X is the U parameter. *dx,dy,dz* and *ux,uy,uz* must not be null or collinear. *ux,uy,uz* will be modified to be orthogonal to *dx,dy,dz*. 

There are default values for the coordinate system. If no arguments are given, the global system (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0). If only the origin is given, the axes are those given by default(0,0,1), (1,0,0). If the origin and the Z axis are given, the X axis is generated perpendicular to the Z axis. 

Note that this definition will be used for all analytical surfaces. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a plane through the point 10,0,0 perpendicular to X 
# with U direction on Y 
plane p1 10 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 

# an horixontal plane with origin 10, -20, -5

~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_2  cylinder

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
cylinder name [x y z [dx dy dz [ux uy uz]]] radius 
~~~~

A cylinder is defined by a coordinate system, and a radius. The surface generated is an infinite cylinder with the Z axis as the axis. The U parameter is the angle starting from X going in the Y direction. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a cylinder on the default Z axis, radius 10 
cylinder c1 10 

# a cylinder, also along the Z axis but with origin 5,

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_3  cone

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
cone name [x y z [dx dy dz [ux uy uz]]] semi-angle radius 
~~~~
Creates a cone in the infinite coordinate system along the Z-axis. The radius is that of the circle at the intersection of the cone and the XY plane. The semi-angle is the angle formed by the cone relative to the axis; it should be between -90 and 90. If the radius is 0, the vertex is the origin. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a cone at 45 degrees at the origin on Z 
cone c1 45 0 

# a cone on axis Z with radius r1 at z1 and r2 at z2 
cone c2 0 0 z1 180.*atan2(r2-r1,z2-z1)/pi r1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_4  sphere

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
sphere name [x y z [dx dy dz [ux uy uz]]] radius 
~~~~

Creates a sphere in the local coordinate system defined in the **plane** command. The sphere is centered at the origin. 

To parameterize the sphere, *u* is the angle from X to Y, between 0 and 2*pi. *v* is the angle in the half-circle at angle *u* in the plane containing the Z axis. *v* is between -pi/2 and pi/2. The poles are the points Z = +/- radius; their parameters are u,+/-pi/2 for any u in 0,2*pi. 

**Example:**
~~~~{.php}
# a sphere at the origin 
sphere s1 10 
# a sphere at 10 10 10, with poles on the axis 1,1,1 
sphere s2 10 10 10 1 1 1 10

* **vpbsplinesurf** creates one periodic in v; 
* **uvpbsplinesurf** creates one periodic in uv. 

The syntax is similar to the *bsplinecurve* command. First give the degree in u and the knots in u with their multiplicities, then do the same in v. The poles follow. The number of poles is the product of the number in u and the number in v. 

See *bsplinecurve* to compute the number of poles, the poles are first given in U as in the *beziersurf* command. You must give weights if the surface is rational. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create a bspline surface of degree 1 2 
# with two knots in U and three in V 
bsplinesurf s \ 
1 2 0 2 1 2 \ 
2 3 0 3 1 1 2 3 \ 
0 0 0 1 10 0 5 1 \ 
0 10 2 1 10 10 3 1 \

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_8  trim, trimu, trimv

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
trim newname name [u1 u2 [v1 v2] [usense vsense]]
trimu newname name u1 u2 [usense]
trimv newname name v1 v2 [vsense]
~~~~

The **trim** commands create trimmed curves or trimmed surfaces. Note that trimmed curves and surfaces are classes of the *Geom* package. 
* *trim* creates either a new trimmed curve from a curve or a new trimmed surface in u and v from a surface.
* *trimu* creates a u-trimmed surface, 
* *trimv* creates a v-trimmed surface. 

After an initial trim, a second execution with no parameters given recreates the basis curve. The curves can be either 2d or 3d. If the trimming parameters decrease and if the curve or surface is not periodic, the direction is reversed. 

**Note** that a trimmed curve or surface contains a copy of the basis geometry: modifying that will not modify the trimmed geometry. Trimming trimmed geometry will not create multiple levels of trimming. The basis geometry will be used. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create a 3d circle 
circle c 0 0 0 10 

# trim it, use the same variable, the original is 
deleted 
trim c c 0 pi/2 

# the original can be recovered! 
trim orc c 

# trim again 
trim c c pi/4 pi/2 

# the original is not the trimmed curve but the basis 
trim orc c 

# as the circle is periodic, the two following commands 
are identical 
trim cc c pi/2 0 
trim cc c pi/2 2*pi 

# trim an infinite cylinder 
cylinder cy 10 
trimv cy cy 0 50 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_9  offset

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
offset name basename distance [dx dy dz]
~~~~

Creates offset curves or surfaces at a given distance from a basis curve or surface. Offset curves and surfaces are classes from the *Geom *package. 

The curve can be a 2d or a 3d curve. To compute the offsets for a 3d curve, you must also give a vector *dx,dy,dz*. For a planar curve, this vector is usually the normal to the plane containing the curve. 

The offset curve or surface copies the basic geometry, which can be modified later. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# graphic demonstration that the outline of a torus 
# is the offset of an ellipse 
smallview +X+Y 
dset angle pi/6 
torus t 0 0 0 0 cos(angle) sin(angle) 50 20 
fit 
ellipse e 0 0 0 50 50*sin(angle) 
# note that the distance can be negative 
offset l1 e 20 0 0 1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_10  revsurf

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
revsurf name curvename x y z dx dy dz
~~~~

Creates a surface of revolution from a 3d curve. 

A surface of revolution or revolved surface is obtained by rotating a curve (called the *meridian*) through a complete revolution about an axis (referred to as the *axis of revolution*). The curve and the axis must be in the same plane (the *reference plane* of the surface). Give the point of origin x,y,z and the vector dx,dy,dz to define the axis of revolution. 

To parameterize a surface of revolution: u is the angle of rotation around the axis. Its origin is given by the position of the meridian on the surface. v is the parameter of the meridian. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# another way of creating a torus like surface 
circle c 50 0 0 20 
revsurf s c 0 0 0 0 1 0 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_11  extsurf

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
extsurf newname curvename dx dy dz 
~~~~

Creates a surface of linear extrusion from a 3d curve. The basis curve is swept in a given direction,the *direction of extrusion* defined by a vector. 

In the syntax, *dx,dy,dz* gives the direction of extrusion. 

To parameterize a surface of extrusion: *u* is the parameter along the extruded curve; the *v* parameter is along the direction of extrusion. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# an elliptic cylinder 
ellipse e 0 0 0 10 5 
extsurf s e 0 0 1 
# to make it finite 
trimv s s 0 10 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_3_12  convert

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
convert newname name 
~~~~

Creates a 2d or 3d NURBS curve or a NURBS surface from any 2d curve, 3d curve or surface. In other words, conics, beziers and bsplines are turned into NURBS. Offsets are not processed.
 
**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# turn a 2d arc of a circle into a 2d NURBS 
circle c 0 0 5 
trim c c 0 pi/3 
convert c1 c 

# an easy way to make a planar bspline surface 
plane p 
trim p p -1 1 -1 1 
convert p1 p 
~~~~

**Note** that offset curves and surfaces are not processed by this command.

@subsection occt_draw_6_4  Curve and surface modifications

Draw provides commands to modify curves and surfaces, some of them are general, others restricted to bezier curves or bsplines. 

General modifications: 

  * Reversing the parametrization: **reverse**, **ureverse**, **vreverse**

Modifications for both bezier curves and bsplines: 

  * Exchanging U and V on a surface: **exchuv**
  * Segmentation: **segment**, **segsur**
  * Increasing the degree: **incdeg**, **incudeg**, **incvdeg**
  * Moving poles: **cmovep**, **movep**, **movecolp**, **moverowp**

Modifications for bezier curves: 

  * Adding and removing poles: **insertpole**, **rempole**, **remcolpole**, **remrowpole**

Modifications for bspline: 

  * Inserting and removing knots: **insertknot**, **remknot**, **insertuknot**, **remuknot**, **insetvknot**, **remvknot**
  * Modifying periodic curves and surfaces: **setperiodic**, **setnotperiodic**, **setorigin**, **setuperiodic**, **setunotperiodic**, **setuorigin**, **setvperiodic**, **setvnotperiodic**, **setvorigin**



@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_1  reverse, ureverse, vreverse


Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
reverse curvename 
ureverse surfacename 
vreverse surfacename 
~~~~

The **reverse** command reverses the parameterization and inverses the orientation of a 2d or 3d curve. Note that the geometry is modified. To keep the curve or the surface, you must copy it before modification. 

**ureverse** or **vreverse** reverse the u or v parameter of a surface. Note that the new parameters of the curve may change according to the type of curve. For instance, they will change sign on a line or stay 0,1 on a bezier. 

Reversing a parameter on an analytical surface may create an indirect coordinate system. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# reverse a trimmed 2d circle 
circle c 0 0 5 
trim c c pi/4 pi/2 
reverse c 

# dumping c will show that it is now trimmed between 
# 3*pi/2 and 7*pi/4 i.e. 2*pi-pi/2 and 2*pi-pi/4 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_2  exchuv

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
exchuv surfacename 
~~~~

For a bezier or bspline surface this command exchanges the u and v parameters. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# exchanging u and v on a spline (made from a cylinder) 
cylinder c 5 
trimv c c 0 10 
convert c1 c 
exchuv c1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_3  segment, segsur

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
segment curve Ufirst Ulast 
segsur surface Ufirst Ulast Vfirst Vlast 
~~~~

**segment** and **segsur** segment a bezier curve and a bspline curve or surface respectively. 

These commands modify the curve to restrict it between the new parameters: *Ufirst*, the starting point of the modified curve, and *Ulast*, the end point. *Ufirst* is less than *Ulast*. 

This command must not be confused with **trim** which creates a new geometry. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# segment a bezier curve in half 
beziercurve c 3 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 10 0 
segment c ufirst ulast 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_4  iincudeg, incvdeg

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
incudeg surfacename newdegree 
incvdeg surfacename newdegree 
~~~~

**incudeg** and **incvdeg** increase the degree in the U or V parameter of a bezier or bspline surface.
 
**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# make a planar bspline and increase the degree to 2 3 
plane p 
trim p p -1 1 -1 1 
convert p1 p 
incudeg p1 2 
incvdeg p1 3 
~~~~

**Note** that the geometry is modified.


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_5  cmovep, movep, movecolp, moverowp

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
cmovep curve index dx dy [dz] 
movep surface uindex vindex dx dy dz 
movecolp surface uindex dx dy dz 
moverowp surface vindex dx dy dz 
~~~~

**move** methods translate poles of a bezier curve, a bspline curve or a bspline surface. 
* **cmovep** and **movep** translate one pole with a given index. 
* **movecolp** and **moverowp** translate a whole column (expressed by the *uindex*) or row (expressed by the *vindex*) of poles. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# start with a plane 
# transform to bspline, raise degree and add relief 
plane p 
trim p p -10 10 -10 10 
convert p1 p 
incud p1 2 
incvd p1 2 
movecolp p1 2 0 0 5 
moverowp p1 2 0 0 5 
movep p1 2 2 0 0 5 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_6  insertpole, rempole, remcolpole, remrowpole

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
insertpole curvename index x y [z] [weight] 
rempole curvename index 
remcolpole surfacename index 
remrowpole surfacename index
~~~~

**insertpole** inserts a new pole into a 2d or 3d bezier curve. You may add a weight for the pole. The default value for the weight is 1. The pole is added at the position after that of the index pole. Use an index 0 to insert the new pole before the first one already existing in your drawing. 

**rempole** removes a pole from a 2d or 3d bezier curve. Leave at least two poles in the curves. 

**remcolpole** and **remrowpole** remove a column or a row of poles from a bezier surface. A column is in the v direction and a row in the u direction The resulting degree must be at least 1; i.e there will be two rows and two columns left. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# start with a segment, insert a pole at end 
# then remove the central pole 
beziercurve c 2 0 0 0 10 0 0 
insertpole c 2 10 10 0 
rempole c 2 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_7  insertknot, insertuknot, insertvknot

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
insertknot name knot [mult = 1] [knot mult ...] 
insertuknot surfacename knot mult 
insertvknot surfacename knot mult 
~~~~

**insertknot** inserts knots in the knot sequence of a bspline curve. You must give a knot value and a target multiplicity. The default multiplicity is 1. If there is already a knot with the given value and a multiplicity lower than the target one, its multiplicity will be raised. 

**insertuknot** and **insertvknot** insert knots in a surface. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create a cylindrical surface and insert a knot 
cylinder c 10 
trim c c 0 pi/2 0 10 
convert c1 c 
insertuknot c1 pi/4 1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_8  remknot, remuknot, remvknot

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
remknot index [mult] [tol] 
remuknot index [mult] [tol] 
remvknot index [mult] [tol] 
~~~~

**remknot** removes a knot from the knot sequence of a curve or a surface. Give the index of the knot and optionally, the target multiplicity. If the target multiplicity is not 0, the multiplicity of the knot will be lowered. As the curve may be modified, you are allowed to set a tolerance to control the process. If the tolerance is low, the knot will only be removed if the curve will not be modified. 

By default, if no tolerance is given, the knot will always be removed. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# bspline circle, remove a knot 
circle c 0 0 5 
convert c1 c 
incd c1 5 
remknot c1 2 
~~~~

**Note** that Curves or Surfaces may be modified.


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_9  setperiodic, setnotperiodic, setuperiodic, setunotperiodic, setvperiodic, setvnotperiodic

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
setperiodic curve 
setnotperiodic curve 
setuperiodic surface 
setunotperiodic surface 
setvperiodic surface 
setvnotperiodic surface
~~~~

**setperiodic** turns a bspline curve into a periodic bspline curve; the knot vector stays the same and excess poles are truncated. The curve may be modified if it has not been closed. **setnotperiodic** removes the periodicity of a periodic curve. The pole table mau be modified. Note that knots are added at the beginning and the end of the knot vector and the multiplicities are knots set to degree+1 at the start and the end. 

**setuperiodic** and **setvperiodic** make the u or the v parameter of bspline surfaces periodic; **setunotperiodic**, and **setvnotperiodic** remove periodicity from the u or the v parameter of bspline surfaces. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a circle deperiodicized 
circle c 0 0 5 
convert c1 c 
setnotperiodic c1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_4_10  setorigin, setuorigin, setvorigin

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
setorigin curvename index 
setuorigin surfacename index 
setuorigin surfacename index 
~~~~

These commands change the origin of the parameters on periodic curves or surfaces. The new origin must be an existing knot. To set an origin other than an existing knot, you must first insert one with the *insertknot* command. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a torus with new U and V origins 
torus t 20 5 
convert t1 t 
setuorigin t1 2 
setvorigin t1 2
~~~~


@subsection occt_draw_6_5  Transformations

Draw provides commands to apply linear transformations to geometric objects: they include translation, rotation, mirroring and scaling. 

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_5_1  translate, dtranslate

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
translate name [names ...] dx dy dz 
2dtranslate name [names ...] dx dy 
~~~~

The **Translate** command translates 3d points, curves and surfaces along a vector *dx,dy,dz*. You can translate more than one object with the same command. 

For 2d points or curves, use the **2dtranslate** command. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# 3d translation 
point p 10 20 30 
circle c 10 20 30 5 
torus t 10 20 30 5 2 
translate p c t 0 0 15
~~~~
 
*NOTE* 
*Objects are modified by this command.* 

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_5_2  rotate, 2drotate

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
rotate name [name ...] x y z dx dy dz angle 
2drotate name [name ...] x y angle
~~~~

The **rotate** command rotates a 3d point curve or surface. You must give an axis of rotation with a point *x,y,z*, a vector *dx,dy,dz* and an angle in degrees. 

For a 2d rotation, you need only give the center point and the angle. In 2d or 3d, the angle can be negative. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# make a helix of circles. create a script file with 
this code and execute it using **source**. 
circle c0 10 0 0 3 
for {set i 1} {$i <= 10} {incr i} { 
copy c[expr $i-1] c$i 
translate c$i 0 0 3 
rotate c$i 0 0 0 0 0 1 36 
} 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_5_3  pmirror, lmirror, smirror, dpmirror, dlmirror

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
pmirror name [names ...] x y z 
lmirror name [names ...] x y z dx dy dz 
smirror name [names ...] x y z dx dy dz 
2dpmirror name [names ...] x y 
2dlmirror name [names ...] x y dx dy 
~~~~

The mirror commands perform a mirror transformation of 2d or 3d geometry. 

* **pmirror** is the point mirror, mirroring 3d curves and surfaces about a point of symmetry. 
* **lmirror** is the line mirror commamd, mirroring 3d curves and surfaces about an axis of symmetry.
* **smirror** is the surface mirror, mirroring 3d curves and surfaces about a plane of symmetry. In the last case, the plane of symmetry is perpendicular to dx,dy,dz. 
* **2dpmirror** is the point mirror in 2D.
* **2dlmirror** is the axis symmetry mirror in 2D.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# build 3 images of a torus 
torus t 10 10 10 1 2 3 5 1 
copy t t1 
pmirror t1 0 0 0 
copy t t2 
lmirror t2 0 0 0 1 0 0 
copy t t3 
smirror t3 0 0 0 1 0 0 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_5_4  pscale, dpscale

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
pscale name [name ...] x y z s 
2dpscale name [name ...] x y s 
~~~~

The **pscale** and **2dpscale** commands transform an object by point scaling. You must give the center and the scaling factor. Because other scalings modify the type of the object, they are not provided. For example, a sphere may be transformed into an ellipsoid. Using a scaling factor of -1 is similar to using **pmirror**.

 
**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# double the size of a sphere 
sphere s 0 0 0 10 
pscale s 0 0 0 2 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_6_6  Curve and surface analysis

cvalue curve U x y z [d1x d1y d1z [d2x d2y d2z]] 
2dcvalue curve U x y [d1x d1y [d2x d2y]] 
~~~~

For a curve at a given parameter, and depending on the number of arguments, **cvalue** computes the coordinates in *x,y,z*, the first derivative in *d1x,d1y,d1z* and the second derivative in *d2x,d2y,d2z*. 

**Example:**

Let on a bezier curve at parameter 0 the point is the first pole; the first derivative is the vector to the second pole multiplied by the degree; the second derivative is the difference first to the second pole, second to the third pole multipied by *degree-1* : 

~~~~{.php}
2dbeziercurve c 4 0 0 1 1 2 1 3 0 
2dcvalue c 0 x y d1x d1y d2x d2y 

# values of x y d1x d1y d2x d2y

~~~~{.php}
svalue surfname U v x y z [dux duy duz dvx dvy dvz [d2ux d2uy d2uz d2vx d2vy d2vz d2uvx d2uvy d2uvz]] 
~~~~

Computes points and derivatives on a surface for a pair of parameter values. The result depends on the number of arguments. You can compute the first and the second derivatives. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# display points on a sphere 
sphere s 10 
for {dset t 0} {[dval t] <= 1} {dset t t+0.01} { 
svalue s t*2*pi t*pi-pi/2 x y z 
point . x y z 
} 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_6_4  localprop, minmaxcurandinf

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
localprop curvename U 
minmaxcurandinf curve
~~~~

**localprop** computes the curvature of a curve. 
**minmaxcurandinf** computes and prints the parameters of the points where the curvature is minimum and maximum on a 2d curve. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# show curvature at the center of a bezier curve 
beziercurve c 3 0 0 0 10 2 0 20 0 0 
localprop c 0.5

~~~~

Returns the parameters on the surface of the 3d point *x,y,z* in variables *u* and *v*. This command may only be used on analytical surfaces: plane, cylinder, cone, sphere and torus. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# Compute parameters on a plane 
plane p 0 0 10 1 1 0 
parameters p 5 5 5 u v 
# the values of u and v are : 0 5 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_6_6  proj, 2dproj

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
proj name x y z 
2dproj name xy 
~~~~

Use **proj** to project a point on a 3d curve or a surface and **2dproj** for a 2d curve. 

The command will compute and display all points in the projection. The lines joining the point to the projections are created with the names *ext_1, ext_2, ... *

**Example:** 

Let us project a point on a torus 

~~~~{.php}
torus t 20 5 
proj t 30 10 7 
== ext_1 ext_2 ext_3 ext_4 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_6_7  surface_radius

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
surface_radius surface u v [c1 c2] 
~~~~

Computes the main curvatures of a surface at parameters *(u,v)*. If there are extra arguments, their curvatures are stored in variables *c1* and *c2*. 

**Example:**

2dapprox result nbpoint [curve / x1 y1 x2 y2]
~~~~

These commands fit a curve through a set of points. First give the number of points, then choose one of the three ways available to get the points. If you have no arguments, click on the points. If you have a curve argument or a list of points, the command launches computation of the points on the curve.

surfint name surf nbupoints nbvpoints [periodic_flag = 0]
~~~~

* **surfapp** fits a surface through an array of u and v points, nbupoints*nbvpoints. 
* **grilapp** has the same function, but the x,y coordinates of the points are on a grid starting at x0,y0 with steps dx,dy. 
* **surfapp** can take array of points from other input surface, if alternative syntax
**surfapp** name nbupoints nbvpoints surf [periodic_flag = 0]
is used.
Both command use for fitting approximation algorithm.
**surfint** uses interpolation algorithm and can take array of point only from other input surface.
Optional parameter **periodic_flag** allows to get correct periodical surfaces in U direction.
U direction of result surface corresponds columns of initial array of points.
If **periodic_flag** = 1, algorithm uses first row of array as last row and builds periodical surface.

**Example:**

@subsection occt_draw_6_11  Display

Draw provides commands to control the display of geometric objects. Some display parameters are used for all objects, others are valid for surfaces only, some for bezier and bspline only, and others for bspline only. 

On curves and surfaces, you can control the mode of representation with the **dmode** command. You can control the parameters for the mode with the **defle** command and the **discr** command, which control deflection and discretization respectively. 

On surfaces, you can control the number of isoparametric curves displayed on the surface with the **nbiso** command. 

On bezier and bspline curve and surface you can toggle the display of the control points with the **clpoles** and **shpoles** commands. 

On bspline curves and surfaces you can toggle the display of the knots with the **shknots** and **clknots** commands. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_6_11_1  dmod, discr, defle

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
dmode name [name ...] u/d 
discr name [name ...] nbintervals 
defle name [name ...] deflection 
~~~~

**dmod** command allows choosing the display mode for a curve or a surface. 

In mode *u*, or *uniform deflection*, the points are computed to keep the polygon at a distance lower than the deflection of the geometry. The deflection is set with the *defle* command. This mode involves intensive use of computational power. 

In *d*, or discretization mode, a fixed number of points is computed. This number is set with the *discr* command. This is the default mode. On a bspline, the fixed number of points is computed for each span of the curve. (A span is the interval between two knots). 

If the curve or the isolines seem to present too many angles, you can either increase the discretization or lower the deflection, depending on the mode. This will increase the number of points. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# increment the number of points on a big circle 
circle c 0 0 50 50 
discr 100 

# change the mode 
dmode c u 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_11_2   nbiso

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
nbiso name [names...] nuiso nviso 
~~~~

Changes the number of isoparametric curves displayed on a surface in the U and V directions. On a bspline surface, isoparametric curves are displayed by default at knot values. Use *nbiso* to turn this feature off. 

**Example:** 

Let us  display 35 meridians and 15 parallels on a sphere:
~~~~{.php}
sphere s 20 
nbiso s 35 15 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_11_3  clpoles, shpoles

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
clpoles name 
shpoles name 
~~~~

On bezier and bspline curves and surfaces, the control polygon is displayed by default: *clpoles* erases it and *shpoles* restores it. 

**Example:** 

Let us make a bezier curve and erase the poles 

~~~~{.php}
beziercurve c 3 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 10 0 
clpoles c 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_6_11_4  clknots, shknots

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
clknots name 
shknots name 
~~~~

By default, knots on a bspline curve or surface are displayed with markers at the points with parametric value equal to the knots. *clknots* removes them and *shknots* restores them. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# hide the knots on a bspline curve 
bsplinecurve bc 2 3 0 3 1 1 2 3 \ 
10 0 7 1 7 0 7 1 3 0 8 1 0 0 7 1

@section occt_draw_7 Topology commands

Draw provides a set of commands to test OCCT Topology libraries. The Draw commands are found in the DRAWEXE executable or in any executable including the BRepTest commands. 

Topology defines the relationship between simple geometric entities, which can thus be linked together to represent complex shapes. The type of variable used by Topology in Draw is the shape variable. 

The <a href="user_guides__modeling_data.html#occt_modat_5">different topological shapes</a> include: 

  * **COMPOUND**: A group of any type of topological object.
  * **COMPSOLID**: A set of solids connected by their faces. This expands the notions of WIRE and SHELL to solids.
  * **SOLID**: A part of space limited by shells. It is three dimensional.
  * **SHELL**: A set of faces connected by their edges. A shell can be open or closed.
  * **FACE**: In 2d, a plane; in 3d, part of a surface. Its geometry is constrained (trimmed) by contours. It is two dimensional.
  * **WIRE**: A set of edges connected by their vertices. It can be open or closed depending on whether the edges are linked or not.
  * **EDGE**: A topological element corresponding to a restrained curve. An edge is generally limited by vertices. It has one dimension.
  * **VERTEX**: A topological element corresponding to a point. It has a zero dimension.

Shapes are usually shared. **copy** will create a new shape which shares its representation with the original. Nonetheless, two shapes sharing the same topology can be moved independently (see the section on **transformation**). 

The following topics are covered in the eight sections of this chapter: 

  * Basic shape commands to handle the structure of shapes and control the display.
  * Curve and surface topology, or methods to create topology from geometry and vice versa.
  * Primitive construction commands: box, cylinder, wedge etc.
  * Sweeping of shapes.
  * Transformations of shapes: translation, copy, etc.
  * Topological operations, or booleans.
  * Drafting and blending.
  * Defeaturing.
  * Making shapes periodic in 3D space.
  * Making shapes connected.
  * Analysis of shapes.


@subsection occt_draw_7_1  Basic topology

The set of basic commands allows simple operations on shapes, or step-by-step construction of objects. These commands are useful for analysis of shape structure and include: 

  * **isos** and **discretisation** to control display of shape faces by isoparametric curves .
  * **orientation**, **complement** and **invert** to modify topological attributes such as orientation.
  * **explode**, **exwire** and **nbshapes** to analyze the structure of a shape.
  * **emptycopy**, **add**, **compound** to create shapes by stepwise construction.

In Draw, shapes are displayed using isoparametric curves. There is color coding for the edges: 

  * a red edge is an isolated edge, which belongs to no faces.
  * a green edge is a free boundary edge, which belongs to one face,
  * a yellow edge is a shared edge, which belongs to at least two faces.


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_1_1  isos, discretisation

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
isos [name ...][nbisos] 
discretisation nbpoints
~~~~
 
Determines or changes the number of isoparametric curves on shapes. 

The same number is used for the u and v directions. With no arguments, *isos* prints the current default value. To determine, the number of isos for a shape, give it name as the first argument. 

*discretisation* changes the default number of points used to display the curves. The default value is 30. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# Display only the edges (the wireframe) 
isos 0 
~~~~

**Warning**: don’t confuse *isos* and *discretisation* with the geometric commands *nbisos* and *discr*. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_1_2  orientation, complement, invert, normals, range

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
orientation name [name ...] F/R/E/I 
complement name [name ...] 
invert name 
normals s (length = 10), disp normals 
range name value value 
~~~~

* **orientation** -- assigns the orientation of simple and complex shapes to one of the following four values: *FORWARD, REVERSED, INTERNAL, EXTERNAL*. 
* **complement** -- changes the current orientation of shapes to its complement: *FORWARD* to *REVERSED* and  *INTERNAL* to *EXTERNAL*. 
* **invert** -- creates a copy of the original shape with a reversed orientation of all subshapes. For example, it may be useful to reverse the normals of a solid. 
* *normals** -- returns the assignment of colors to orientation values. 
* **range** -- defines the length of a selected edge by defining the values of a starting point and an end point.
 
**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# to invert normals of a box 
box b 10 20 30 
normals b 5 
invert b 
normals b 5 

# to assign a value to an edge 
box b1 10 20 30 
# to define the box as edges 
explode b1 e 
b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4 b_5 b_6 b_7 b_8 b_9 b_10 b_11 b_12 
# to define as an edge 
makedge e 1 
# to define the length of the edge as starting from 0 
and finishing at 1 
range e 0 1 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_1_3  explode, exwire, nbshapes

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
explode name [C/So/Sh/F/W/E/V] 
exwire name 
nbshapes name 
~~~~

**explode** extracts subshapes from an entity. The subshapes will be named *name_1*, *name_2*, ... Note that they are not copied but shared with the original. 

With name only, **explode** will extract the first sublevel of shapes: the shells of a solid or the edges of a wire, for example. With one argument, **explode** will extract all subshapes of that type: *C* for compounds, *So* for solids, *Sh* for shells, *F* for faces, *W* for wires, *E* for edges, *V* for vertices. 

**exwire** is a special case of **explode** for wires, which extracts the edges in an ordered way, if possible. Each edge, for example, is connected to the following one by a vertex. 

**nbshapes** counts the number of shapes of each type in an entity. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# on a box 
box b 10 20 30 

# whatis returns the type and various information 
whatis b 
= b is a shape SOLID FORWARD Free Modified 

# make one shell 
explode b 
whatis b_1 
= b_1 is a shape SHELL FORWARD Modified Orientable 
Closed 

# extract the edges b_1, ... , b_12 
explode b e 
==b_1 ... b_12 

# count subshapes 
nbshapes b 
== 
Number of shapes in b 
VERTEX : 8 
EDGE : 12 
WIRE : 6 
FACE : 6 
SHELL : 1 
SOLID : 1 
COMPSOLID : 0 
COMPOUND : 0 
SHAPE : 34 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_1_4  emptycopy, add, compound

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
emptycopy [newname] name 
add name toname 
compound [name ...] compoundname 
~~~~

**emptycopy** returns an empty shape with the same orientation, location, and geometry as the target shape, but with no sub-shapes. If the **newname** argument is not given, the new shape is stored with the same name. This command is used to modify a frozen shape. A frozen shape is a shape used by another one. To modify it, you must **emptycopy** it. Its subshape may be reinserted with the **add** command. 

**add** inserts shape *C* into shape *S*. Verify that *C* and *S* reference compatible types of objects: 
  * Any *Shape* can be added to a *Compound*.
  * Only a *Solid* can be added to a *CompSolid*.
  * Only a *Shell* can *Edge* or a *Vertex* can be added into a *Solid*.
  * Only a *Face* can be added to a *Shell*.
  * Only a *Wire* and *Vertex* can be added in a *Solid*.
  * Only an *Edge* can be added to a *Wire*.
  * Only a *Vertex* can be added to an *Edge*.
  * Nothing can be added to a *Vertex*.

**emptycopy** and **add** should be used with care. 

On the other hand, **compound** is a safe way to achieve a similar result. It creates a compound from shapes. If no shapes are given, the compound is empty. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a compound with three boxes 
box b1 0 0 0 1 1 1 
box b2 3 0 0 1 1 1 
box b3 6 0 0 1 1 1 
compound b1 b2 b3 c 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_1_5  compare

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
compare shape1 shape2
~~~~

**compare** compares the two shapes *shape1* and *shape2* using the methods *TopoDS_Shape::IsSame()* and *TopoDS_Shape::IsEqual()*.

**Example**
~~~~{.php}
box b1 1 1 1
copy b1 b2
compare b1 b2
# same shapes
# equal shapes

orientation b2 R
compare b1 b2
# same shapes

box b2 1 1 1
compare b1 b2
# shapes are not same
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_1_6  issubshape

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
issubshape subshape shape
~~~~

**issubshape** checks if the shape *subshape* is sub-shape of the shape *shape* and gets its index in the shape.

**Example**
~~~~{.php}
box b 1 1 1
explode b f
issubshape b_2 b
# b_2 is sub-shape of b. Index in the shape: 2.
~~~~


@subsection occt_draw_7_2  Curve and surface topology

This group of commands is used to create topology from shapes and to extract shapes from geometry. 

  * To create vertices, use the **vertex** command.
  * To create edges use, the **edge**, **mkedge** commands.
  * To create wires, use the **wire**, **polyline**, **polyvertex** commands.
  * To create faces, use the **mkplane**, **mkface** commands.
  * To extract the geometry from edges or faces, use the **mkcurve** and **mkface** commands.
  * To extract the 2d curves from edges or faces, use the **pcurve** command.


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_1  vertex

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
vertex name [x y z / p edge] 
~~~~

Creates a vertex at either a 3d location x,y,z or the point at parameter p on an edge. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
vertex v1 10 20 30 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_1a  mkpoint

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
mkpoint name vertex
~~~~

Creates a point from the coordinates of a given vertex.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
mkpoint p v1
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_2  edge, mkedge, uisoedge, visoedge

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
edge name vertex1 vertex2 
mkedge edge curve [surface] [pfirst plast] [vfirst [pfirst] vlast [plast]] 
uisoedge edge face u v1 v2 
visoedge edge face v u1 u2 
~~~~

* **edge** creates a straight line edge between two vertices. 
* **mkedge** generates edges from curves<.Two parameters can be given for the vertices: the first and last parameters of the curve are given by default. Vertices can also be given with their parameters, this option allows blocking the creation of new vertices. If the parameters of the vertices are not given, they are computed by projection on the curve. Instead of a 3d curve, a 2d curve and a surface can be given. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# straight line edge 
vertex v1 10 0 0 
vertex v2 10 10 0 
edge e1 v1 v2 

# make a circular edge 
circle c 0 0 0 5 
mkedge e2 c 0 pi/2 

# A similar result may be achieved by trimming the curve 
# The trimming is removed by mkedge 
trim c c 0 pi/2 
mkedge e2 c 
~~~~

* **visoedge** and **uisoedge** are commands that generate a *uiso* parameter edge or a *viso* parameter edge. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}

uisoedge e p 0.5 0.20 0.8 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_3  wire, polyline, polyvertex

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
wire wirename e1/w1 [e2/w2 ...] 
polyline name x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ... 
polyvertex name v1 v2 ... 
~~~~

**wire** creates a wire from edges or wires. The order of the elements should ensure that the wire is connected, and vertex locations will be compared to detect connection. If the vertices are different, new edges will be created to ensure topological connectivity. The original edge may be copied in the new one. 

**polyline** creates a polygonal wire from point coordinates. To make a closed wire, you should give the first point again at the end of the argument list. 

**polyvertex** creates a polygonal wire from vertices. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create two polygonal wires 
# glue them and define as a single wire 
polyline w1 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 10 0 
polyline w2 10 10 0 0 10 0 0 0 0

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_4  profile

Syntax       
~~~~{.php}
profile name [code values] [code values] ... 
~~~~


**profile** builds a profile in a plane using a moving point and direction. By default, the profile is closed and a face is created. The original point is 0 0, and direction is 1 0 situated in the XY plane.

| C                 |                Radius Angle    |      Arc of circle tangent to direction |


Codes and values are used to define the next point or change the direction. When the profile changes from a straight line to a curve, a tangent is created. All angles are in degrees and can be negative. 

The point [code values] can be repeated any number of times and in any order to create the profile contour. 

| Suffix | Action |
| :----- | :----- |
| No suffix  |             Makes a closed face |
| W          |               Make a closed wire |
| WW         |            Make an open wire |

The profile shape definition is the suffix; no suffix produces a face, *w* is a closed wire, *ww* is an open wire. 

Code letters are not case-sensitive.

~~~~

* for an edge : \<digitizes\> ... <mouse button 2>
* to end profile : <mouse button 3>

Builds a profile in the XY plane from digitizes. By default the profile is closed and a face is built. 

**bsplineprof** creates a 2d profile from bspline curves using the mouse as the input. *MB1* creates the points, *MB2* finishes the current curve and starts the next curve, *MB3* closes the profile. 

The profile shape definition is the suffix; no suffix produces a face, **w** is a closed wire, **ww** is an open wire. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_6  mkoffset

**mkoffset** creates a parallel wire in the same plane using a face or an existing continuous set of wires as a reference. The number of occurrences is not limited. 
The offset distance defines the spacing and the positioning of the occurrences. 

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
mkoffset result shape nboffset stepoffset [jointype(a/i) [alt]]
~~~~
Where:
* *result* - the base name for the resulting wires. The index of the occurrence (starting with 1) will be added to this name, so the resulting wires will have the names - *result_1*, *result_2* ...;
* *shape* - input shape (face or compound of wires);
* *nboffset* - the number of the parallel occurrences;
* *stepoffset* - offset distance between occurrences;
* *jointype(a/i)* - join type (a for *arc* (default) and i for *intersection*);
* *alt* - altitude from the plane of the input face in relation to the normal to the face.


**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# Create a box and select a face 
box b 1 2 3 
explode b f 
# Create three exterior parallel contours with an offset value of 2 
mkoffset r b_1 3 2 
# wires r_1, r_2 and r_3 are created

# Create three exterior parallel contours with an offset value of 2 without round corners
mkoffset r b_1 3 2 i
# wires r_1, r_2 and r_3 are created

# Create one interior parallel contour with an offset value of 0.4 
mkoffset r b_1 1 -0.4 
~~~~

**Note** that on a concave input contour for an interior step *mkoffset* command may produce several wires which will be contained in a single compound.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# to create the example contour 
profile p F 0 0 x 2 y 4 tt 1 1 tt 0 4 w 
# creates an incoherent interior offset

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_7  mkplane, mkface

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
mkplane name wire 
mkface name surface [ufirst ulast vfirst vlast] 
~~~~

**mkplane** generates a face from a planar wire. The planar surface will be constructed with an orientation which keeps the face inside the wire. 

**mkface** generates a face from a surface. Parameter values can be given to trim a rectangular area. The default boundaries are those of the surface. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_2_9  pcurve

Syntax:

~~~~{.php}
pcurve [name edgename] facename 
~~~~

Extracts the 2d curve of an edge on a face. If only the face is specified, the command extracts all the curves and colors them according to their orientation. This is useful in checking to see if the edges in a face are correctly oriented, i.e. they turn counter-clockwise. To make curves visible, use a fitted 2d view. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# view the pcurves of a face

Creates chamfers and fillets on 2D objects. Select two adjacent edges and: 
  * a radius value
  * two respective distance values
  * a distance value and an angle

The radius value produces a fillet between the two faces. 

The distance is the length value from the edge between the two selected faces in a normal direction. 

**Example:** 

Let us create a 2d fillet: 

~~~~{.php}

@subsection occt_draw_7_3  Primitives

Primitive commands make it possible to create simple shapes. They include: 

  * **box** and **wedge** commands.
  * **pcylinder**, **pcone**, **psphere**, **ptorus** commands.
  * **halfspace** command


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_3_1  box, wedge

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
box name [x y z] dx dy dz 
wedge name dx dy dz ltx / xmin zmin xmax xmax 
~~~~

**box** creates a box parallel to the axes with dimensions *dx,dy,dz*. *x,y,z* is the corner of the box. It is the default origin. 

**wedge** creates a box with five faces called a wedge. One face is in the OXZ plane, and has dimensions *dx,dz* while the other face is in the plane *y = dy*. This face either has dimensions *ltx, dz* or is bounded by *xmin,zmin,xmax,zmax*. 

The other faces are defined between these faces. The face in the *y=yd* plane may be degenerated into a line if *ltx = 0*, or a point if *xmin = xmax* and *ymin = ymax*. In these cases, the line and the point both have 5 faces each. To position the wedge use the *ttranslate* and *trotate* commands. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a box at the origin 
box b1 10 20 30 

# another box 
box b2 30 30 40 10 20 30 

# a wedge

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_3_2  pcylinder, pcone, psphere, ptorus

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
pcylinder name [plane] radius height [angle] 
pcone name [plane] radius1 radius2 height [angle] 
pcone name [plane] radius1 radius2 height [angle] 
psphere name [plane] radius1 [angle1 angle2] [angle] 
ptorus name [plane] radius1 radius2 [angle1 angle2] [angle] 
~~~~

All these commands create solid blocks in the default coordinate system, using the Z axis as the axis of revolution and the X axis as the origin of the angles. To use another system, translate and rotate the resulting solid or use a plane as first argument to specify a coordinate system. All primitives have an optional last argument which is an angle expressed in degrees and located on the Z axis, starting from the X axis. The default angle is 360. 

**pcylinder** creates a cylindrical block with the given radius and height. 

**pcone** creates a truncated cone of the given height with radius1 in the plane z = 0 and radius2 in the plane z = height. Neither radius can be negative, but one of them can be null. 

**psphere** creates a solid sphere centered on the origin. If two angles, *angle1* and *angle2*, are given, the solid will be limited by two planes at latitude *angle1* and *angle2*. The angles must be increasing and in the range -90,90. 

**ptorus** creates a solid torus with the given radii, centered on the origin, which is a point along the z axis. If two angles increasing in degree in the range 0 -- 360 are given, the solid will be bounded by two planar surfaces at those positions on the circle. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# a can shape 
pcylinder cy 5 10 

# a quarter of a truncated cone 
pcone co 15 10 10 90 

# three-quarters of sphere

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_3_3  halfspace

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
halfspace result face/shell x y z 
~~~~

**halfspace** creates an infinite solid volume based on a face in a defined direction. This volume can be used to perform the boolean operation of cutting a solid by a face or plane. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
box b 0 0 0 1 2 3

@subsection occt_draw_7_4  Sweeping

Sweeping creates shapes by sweeping out a shape along a defined path: 

  * **prism** -- sweeps along a direction.
  * **revol** -- sweeps around an axis.
  * **pipe** -- sweeps along a wire.
  * **mksweep** and **buildsweep** -- to create sweeps by defining the arguments and algorithms.
  * **thrusections** -- creates a sweep from wire in different planes.


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_4_1  prism

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
prism result base dx dy dz [Copy | Inf | SemiInf] 
~~~~

Creates a new shape by sweeping a shape in a direction. Any shape can be swept: a vertex gives an edge; an edge gives a face; and a face gives a solid. 

The shape is swept along the vector *dx dy dz*. The original shape will be shared in the result unless *Copy* is specified. If *Inf* is specified the prism is infinite in both directions. If *SemiInf* is specified the prism is infinite in the *dx,dy,dz* direction, and the length of the vector has no importance. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# sweep a planar face to make a solid 
polyline f 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 5 0 5 5 0 5 15 0 0 15 0 0 0 0 
mkplane f f

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_4_2  revol

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
revol result base x y z dx dy dz angle [Copy] 
~~~~

Creates a new shape by sweeping a base shape through an angle along the axis *x,y,z dx,dy,dz*. As with the prism command, the shape can be of any type and is not shared if *Copy* is specified. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# shell by wire rotation

deletesweep wire 
setsweep options [arg1 [arg2 [...]]] 
simulsweep r [n] [option] 
buildsweep [r] [option] [Tol] 
~~~~

options are : 
 * *-FR* : Tangent and Normal are defined by a Frenet trihedron 
 * *-CF* : Tangent is given by Frenet, the Normal is computed to minimize the torsion 
 * *-DX Surf* : Tangent and Normal are given by Darboux trihedron, surf must be a shell or a face 
 * *-CN dx dy dz* : BiNormal is given by *dx dy dz* 
 * *-FX Tx Ty TZ [Nx Ny Nz]* : Tangent and Normal are fixed 
 * *-G guide* 

These commands are used to create a shape from wires.
One wire is designated as the contour that defines the direction; it is called the spine.
At least one other wire is used to define the sweep profile.
* **mksweep** -- initializes the sweep creation and defines the wire to be used as the spine. 
* **addsweep** -- defines the wire to be used as the profile. 
* **deletesweep** -- cancels the choice of profile wire, without leaving the mksweep mode. You can re-select a profile wire. 
* **setsweep** -- commands the algorithms used for the construction of the sweep. 
* **simulsweep** -- can be used to create a preview of the shape. [n] is the number of sections that are used to simulate the sweep. 
* **buildsweep** -- creates the sweep using the arguments defined by all the commands. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_4_5  thrusections

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
thrusections [-N] result issolid isruled wire1 wire2 [..wire..] 
~~~~

**thrusections** creates a shape using wires that are positioned in different planes. Each wire selected must have the same number of edges and vertices. 
A bezier curve is generated between the vertices of each wire. The option *[-N]* means that no check is made on wires for direction. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}

@subsection occt_draw_7_5  Topological transformation

Transformations are applications of matrices. When the transformation is nondeforming, such as translation or rotation, the object is not copied. The topology localcoordinate system feature is used. The copy can be enforced with the **tcopy** command. 

  * **tcopy** -- makes a copy of the structure of a shape.
  * **ttranslate**, **trotate**, **tmove** and **reset** -- move a shape.
  * **tmirror** and **tscale** -- always modify the shape.


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_5_1   tcopy

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
tcopy name toname [name toname ...] 
~~~~

Copies the structure of one shape, including the geometry, into another, newer shape. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create an edge from a curve and copy it 
beziercurve c 3 0 0 0 10 0 0 20 10 0 
mkedge e1 c 
ttranslate e1 0 5 0 
tcopy e1 e2 
ttranslate e2 0 5 0 
# now modify the curve, only e1 and e2 will be modified 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_5_2   tmove, treset

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
tmove name [name ...] shape 
reset name [name ...] 
~~~~

**tmove** and **reset** modify the location, or the local coordinate system of a shape. 

**tmove** applies the location of a given shape to other shapes. **reset** restores one or several shapes it to its or their original coordinate system(s). 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# create two boxes 
box b1 10 10 10 
box b2 20 0 0 10 10 10 
# translate the first box 
ttranslate b1 0 10 0 
# and apply the same location to b2 
tmove b2 b1 
# return to original positions 
reset b1 b2 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_5_3   ttranslate, trotate

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
ttranslate [name ...] dx dy dz 
trotate [name ...] x y z dx dy dz angle 
~~~~

**ttranslate** translates a set of shapes by a given vector, and **trotate** rotates them by a given angle around an axis. Both commands only modify the location of the shape. 
When creating multiple shapes, the same location is used for all the shapes. (See *toto.tcl* example below. Note that the code of this file can also be directly executed in interactive mode.) 

Locations are very economic in the data structure because multiple occurrences of an object share the topological description.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# make rotated copies of a sphere in between two cylinders 
# create a file source toto.tcl 
# toto.tcl code: 
for {set i 0} {$i < 360} {incr i 20} {

trotate s$i 0 0 0 0 0 1 $i 
} 

# create two cylinders

~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_5_4   tmirror, tscale

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
tmirror name x y z dx dy dz 
tscale name x y z scale 
~~~~

* **tmirror** makes a mirror copy of a shape about a plane x,y,z dx,dy,dz. 

* **Tscale** applies a central homotopic mapping to a shape. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# mirror a portion of cylinder about the YZ plane 
pcylinder c1 10 10 270 
copy c1 c2 
tmirror c2 15 0 0 1 0 0

**Sewing** joins shapes by connecting their adjacent or near adjacent edges. Adjacency can be redefined by modifying the tolerance value. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}

@subsection occt_draw_7_7 Topological operations

The new algorithm of Boolean operations avoids a large number of weak points and limitations presented in the old Boolean operation algorithm.
It also provides wider range of options and diagnostics.
The algorithms of Boolean component are fully described in the @ref specification__boolean_operations "Boolean Operations" of boolean operation user guide.

For the Draw commands to perform operations in Boolean component, read the dedicated section @ref occt_draw_bop "Boolean operations commands"


@subsection occt_draw_7_8  Drafting and blending

Drafting is creation of a new shape by tilting faces through an angle. 

Blending is the creation of a new shape by rounding edges to create a fillet. 

  * Use the **depouille** command for drafting.
  * Use the **chamf** command to add a chamfer to an edge
  * Use the **blend** command for simple blending.
  * Use **bfuseblend** for a fusion + blending operation.
  * Use **bcutblend** for a cut + blending operation.
  * Use **buildevol**, **mkevol**, **updatevol** to realize varying radius blending.


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_8_1  depouille

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
dep result shape dirx diry dirz face angle x y x dx dy dz [face angle...] 
~~~~

Creates a new shape by drafting one or more faces of a shape. 

Identify the shape(s) to be drafted, the drafting direction, and the face(s) with an angle and an axis of rotation for each face. You can use dot syntax to identify the faces. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# draft a face of a box

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_8_2  chamf

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
chamf newname shape edge face S dist 
chamf newname shape edge face dist1 dist2

~~~~

Creates a chamfer along the edge between faces using: 

  * a equal distances from the edge
  * the edge, a face and distance, a second distance
  * the edge, a reference face and an angle

Use the dot syntax to select the faces and edges. 

**Examples:**

Let us create a chamfer based on equal distances from the edge (45 degree angle):
~~~~{.php}
# create a box 
box b 1 2 3 
chamf ch b . . S 0.5 
==Pick an object 
# select an edge 
==Pick an object

Let us create a chamfer based on different distances from the selected edge:
~~~~{.php}
box b 1 2 3 
chamf ch b . . 0.3 0.4 
==Pick an object 
# select an edge 
==Pick an object 
# select an adjacent face

@subsection occt_draw_7_9  Analysis of topology and geometry

Analysis of shapes includes commands to compute length, area, volumes and inertial properties, as well as to compute some aspects impacting shape validity.

  * Use **lprops**, **sprops**, **vprops** to compute integral properties.
  * Use **bounding** to compute and to display the bounding box of a shape.
  * Use **distmini** to calculate the minimum distance between two shapes.
  * Use **isbbinterf** to check if the two shapes are interfered by their bounding boxes.

sprops shape [epsilon] [c[losed]] [x y z] [-skip] [-full] [-tri]
vprops shape [epsilon] [c[losed]] [x y z] [-skip] [-full] [-tri] 
~~~~

* **lprops** computes the mass properties of all edges in the shape with a linear density of 1;
* **sprops** of all faces with a surface density of 1;
* **vprops** of all solids with a density of 1. 

For computation of properties of the shape, exact geometry (curves, surfaces) or
some discrete data (polygons, triangulations) can be used for calculations.
The epsilon, if given, defines relative precision of computation.
The **closed** flag, if present, forces computation only closed shells of the shape.
The centroid coordinates will be put to DRAW variables x y z (if given).
Shared entities will be taken in account only one time in the **skip** mode.
All values are output with the full precision in the **full** mode.
Preferable source of geometry data are triangulations in case if it exists, 
if the **-tri** key is used, otherwise preferable data is exact geometry.
If epsilon is given, exact geometry (curves, surfaces) are used for calculations independently of using key **-tri**.

All three commands print the mass, the coordinates of the center of gravity, the matrix of inertia and the moments. Mass is either the length, the area or the volume. The center and the main axis of inertia are displayed.

Computes and displays the bounding box (BndBox) of a shape. The bounding box is a cuboid that circumscribes the source shape.
Generally, bounding boxes can be divided into two main types:
  - axis-aligned BndBox (AABB). I.e. the box whose edges are parallel to an axis of World Coordinate System (WCS);
  - oriented BndBox (OBB). I.e. not AABB.

Detailed information about this command is available in DRAW help-system (enter "help bounding" in DRAW application).

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_10_2   filling, fillingparam

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
filling result nbB nbC nbP [SurfInit] [edge][face]order... 
edge[face]order... point/u v face order... 
~~~~

Creates a surface between borders. This command uses the **gplate** algorithm but creates a surface that is tangential to the adjacent surfaces. The result is a smooth continuous surface based on the G1 criterion. 

To define the surface border: 

  * enter the number of edges, constraints, and points
  * enumerate the edges, constraints and points

The surface can pass through other points. These are defined after the border definition. 

You can use the *fillingparam* command to access the filling parameters. 

The options are: 

 * <i>-l</i> : to list current values 
 * <i>-i</i> : to set default values 
 * <i>-rdeg nbPonC nbIt anis </i> : to set filling options 
 * <i>-c t2d t3d tang tcur </i> : to set tolerances 
 * <i>-a maxdeg maxseg </i> : Approximation option

@subsection occt_draw_7_11  Complex Topology

Complex topology is the group of commands that modify the topology of shapes. This includes feature modeling. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_11_1  offsetshape, offsetcompshape

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
offsetshape r shape offset [tol] [face ...] 
offsetcompshape r shape offset [face ...] 
~~~~

**offsetshape** and **offsetcompshape** assign a thickness to the edges of a shape. The *offset* value can be negative or positive. This value defines the thickness and direction of the resulting shape. Each face can be removed to create a hollow object. 

The resulting shape is based on a calculation of intersections. In case of simple shapes such as a box, only the adjacent intersections are required and you can use the **offsetshape** command. 

In case of complex shapes, where intersections can occur from non-adjacent edges and faces, use the **offsetcompshape** command. **comp** indicates complete and requires more time to calculate the result. 

The opening between the object interior and exterior is defined by the argument face or faces. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 20 30 
explode b1 f 
== b1_1 b1_2 b1_3 b1_4 b1_5 b1_6 
offsetcompshape r b1 -1 b1_3 
~~~~

featperform prism/revol/pipe/dprism/lf result [[Ffrom] Funtil] 
featperformval prism/revol/dprism/lf result value 
~~~~

**featprism** loads the arguments for a prism with contiguous sides normal to the face. 

**featdprism** loads the arguments for a prism which is created in a direction normal to the face and includes a draft angle. 

**featrevol** loads the arguments for a prism with a circular evolution. 

**featlf** loads the arguments for a linear rib or slot. This feature uses planar faces and a wire as a guideline. 

**featrf** loads the arguments for a rib or slot with a curved surface. This feature uses a circular face and a wire as a guideline. 

**featperform** loads the arguments to create the feature. 

**featperformval** uses the defined arguments to create a feature with a limiting value. 

All the features are created from a set of arguments which are defined when you initialize the feature context. Negative values can be used to create depressions. 

**Examples:** 

Let us create a feature prism with a draft angle and a normal direction :

~~~~{.php}

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_11_3  draft

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
draft result shape dirx diry dirz angle shape/surf/length [-IN/-OUT] [Ri/Ro] [-Internal] 
~~~~

Computes a draft angle surface from a wire. The surface is determined by the draft direction, the inclination of the draft surface, a draft angle, and a limiting distance. 

  * The draft angle is measured in radians.
  * The draft direction is determined by the argument -INTERNAL
  * The argument Ri/Ro deftermines whether the corner edges of the draft surfaces are angular or rounded.
  * Arguments that can be used to define the surface distance are:
   * length, a defined distance
   * shape, until the surface contacts a shape
   * surface, until the surface contacts a surface.

**Note** that the original aim of adding a draft angle to a shape is to produce a shape which can be removed easily from a mould. The Examples below use larger angles than are used normally and the calculation results returned are not indicated.

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# to create a simple profile 
profile p F 0 0 x 2 y 4 tt 0 4 w 
# creates a draft with rounded angles 
draft res p 0 0 1 3 1 -Ro 
# to create a profile with an internal angle

# creates a draft with rounded external angles 
draft res p 0 0 1 3 1 -Ro 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_7_11_4  deform

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
deform newname name CoeffX CoeffY CoeffZ
~~~~

Modifies the shape using the x, y, and z coefficients. You can reduce or magnify the shape in the x,y, and z directions. 
 
**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
pcylinder c 20 20 
deform a c 1 3 5 
# the conversion to bspline is followed by the 
deformation 
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_11_5 nurbsconvert

Syntax:
 
~~~~{.php}
nurbsconvert result name [result name] 
~~~~

Changes the NURBS curve definition of a shape to a Bspline curve definition.
This conversion is required for asymmetric deformation and prepares the arguments for other commands such as **deform**.
The conversion can be necessary when transferring shape data to other applications. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_7_11_6 edgestofaces

**edgestofaces** - The command allows building planar faces from the planar edges randomly located in 3D space.

It has the following syntax:
~~~~{.php}
edgestofaces r_faces edges [-a AngTol -s Shared(0/1)]
~~~~
Options:
 * -a AngTol - angular tolerance used for distinguishing the planar faces;
 * -s Shared(0/1) - boolean flag which defines whether the input edges are already shared or have to be intersected.

@subsection occt_draw_hist History commands

Draw module for @ref occt_modalg_hist "History Information support" includes the command to save history of modifications performed by Boolean operation or sibling commands into a drawable object and the actual history commands:

* **setfillhistory**;
* **savehistory**;
* **isdeleted**;
* **modified**;
* **generated**.

@subsubsection occt_draw_hist_set setfillhistory

*setfillhistory* command controls if the history is needed to be filled in the supported algorithms and saved into the session after the algorithm is done.
By default it is TRUE, i.e. the history is filled and saved.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
setfillhistory  : Controls the history collection by the algorithms and its saving into the session after algorithm is done.
                Usage: setfillhistory [flag]
                w/o arguments prints the current state of the option;
                flag == 0 - history will not be collected and saved;
                flag != 0 - history will be collected and saved into the session (default).
~~~~

Example:
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 10 10 10
setfillhistory 0
bfuse r b1 b2
savehistory h
# No history has been prepared yet.
setfillhistory 1
bfuse r b1 b2
savehistory h
dump h
# *********** Dump of h *************
# History contains:
#  - 2 Deleted shapes;
#  - 52 Modified shapes;
#  - 0 Generated shapes.
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_hist_save savehistory

*savehistory* command saves the history from the session into a drawable object with the given name.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
savehistory     : savehistory name
~~~~

If the history of shape modifications performed during an operation is needed, the *savehistory* command should be called after the command performing the operation.
If another operation supporting history will be performed before the history of the first operation is saved it will be overwritten with the new history.

Example:
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 5 0 0 10 10 15
bfuse r b1 b2
savehistory fuse_hist

dump fuse_hist
#*********** Dump of fuse_hist *************
# History contains:
# - 4 Deleted shapes;
# - 20 Modified shapes;
# - 6 Generated shapes.

unifysamedom ru r
savehistory usd_hist
dump usd_hist
#*********** Dump of usd_hist *************
#History contains:
# - 14 Deleted shapes;
# - 28 Modified shapes;
# - 0 Generated shapes.
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_hist_isdel isdeleted

*isdeleted* command checks if the given shape has been deleted in the given history.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
isdeleted       : isdeleted history shape
~~~~

Example:
~~~~{.php}
box b1 4 4 4 2 2 2
box b2 10 10 10
bcommon r b1 b2

savehistory com_hist
# all vertices, edges and faces of the b2 are deleted
foreach s [join [list [explode b2 v] [explode b2 e] [explode b2 f] ] ] {
  isdeleted com_hist $s
  # Deleted
}
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_hist_mod modified

*modified* command returns the shapes Modified from the given shape in the given history. All modified shapes are put into a compound. If the shape has not been modified, the resulting compound will be empty. Note that if the shape has been modified into a single shape only, it will be returned without enclosure into the compound.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
modified        : modified modified_shapes history shape
~~~~

Example:
~~~~{.php}
box b 10 10 10
explode b e
fillet r b 2 b_1

savehistory fillet_hist

explode b f

modified m3 fillet_hist b_3
modified m5 fillet_hist b_5
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_hist_gen generated

*generated* command returns the shapes Generated from the given shape in the given history. All generated shapes are put into a compound. If no shapes have been generated from the shape, the resulting compound will be empty. Note that; if the shape has generated a single shape only, it will be returned without enclosure into the compound.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
generated       : generated generated_shapes history shape
~~~~

Example:
~~~~{.php}
polyline w1 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 10 0
polyline w2 5 1 10 9 1 10 9 5 10

thrusections r 0 0 w1 w2

generated g21 loft_hist w2_1
generated g22 loft_hist w2_2

compare g11 g21
# equal shapes

compare g12 g22
# equal shapes
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_hist_extension Enabling Draw history support for the algorithms

Draw History mechanism allows fast and easy enabling of the Draw history support for the OCCT algorithms supporting standard history methods.
To enable History commands for the algorithm it is necessary to save the history of the algorithm into the session.
For that, it is necessary to put the following code into the command implementation just after the command is done:
~~~~{.php}
BRepTest_Objects::SetHistory(ListOfArguments, Algorithm);
~~~~

Here is the example of how it is done in the command performing Split operation (see implementation of the *bapisplit* command):
~~~~{.php}
BRepAlgoAPI_Splitter aSplitter;
// setting arguments
aSplitter.SetArguments(BOPTest_Objects::Shapes());
// setting tools
aSplitter.SetTools(BOPTest_Objects::Tools());

// setting options
aSplitter.SetRunParallel(BOPTest_Objects::RunParallel());
aSplitter.SetFuzzyValue(BOPTest_Objects::FuzzyValue());
aSplitter.SetNonDestructive(BOPTest_Objects::NonDestructive());
aSplitter.SetGlue(BOPTest_Objects::Glue());
aSplitter.SetCheckInverted(BOPTest_Objects::CheckInverted());
aSplitter.SetUseOBB(BOPTest_Objects::UseOBB());
aSplitter.SetToFillHistory(BRepTest_Objects::IsHistoryNeeded());

// performing operation
aSplitter.Build();

if (BRepTest_Objects::IsHistoryNeeded())
{
  // Store the history for the Objects (overwrites the history in the session)
  BRepTest_Objects::SetHistory(BOPTest_Objects::Shapes(), aSplitter);
  // Add the history for the Tools
  BRepTest_Objects::AddHistory(BOPTest_Objects::Tools(), aSplitter);
}
~~~~

The method *BRepTest_Objects::IsHistoryNeeded()* controls if the history is needed to be filled in the algorithm and saved into the session after the algorithm is done (*setfillhistory* command controls this option in DRAW).

@section occt_draw_bop Boolean Operations Commands

This chapter describes existing commands of Open CASCADE Draw Test Harness that are used for performing, analyzing, debugging the algorithm in Boolean Component.
See @ref specification__boolean_operations "Boolean operations" user's guide for the description of these algorithms.

@subsection occt_draw_bop_two Boolean Operations on two operands

All commands in this section perform Boolean operations on two shapes. One of them is considered as object, and the other as a tool.

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_two_bop bop, bopfuse, bopcut, boptuc, bopcommon, bopsection

These commands perform Boolean operations on two shapes:
* **bop** performs intersection of given shapes and stores the intersection results into internal Data Structure.
* **bopfuse** creates a new shape representing the union of two shapes.
* **bopcut** creates a new shape representing a subtraction of a second argument from the first one.
* **boptuc** creates a new shape representing a subtraction of a first argument from the second one.
* **bopcommon** creates a new shape representing the intersection of two shapes.
* **bopsection** creates a new shape representing the intersection edges and vertices between shapes.

These commands allow intersecting the shapes only once for building all types of Boolean operations. After *bop* command is done, the other commands in this category use the intersection results prepared by *bop*.
It may be very useful as the intersection part is usually most time-consuming part of the operation.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
bop shape1 shape2 
bopcommon result 
bopfuse result 
bopcut result 
boptuc result 
~~~~

**Example:** 

Let's produce all four boolean operations on a box and a cylinder performing intersection only once:
~~~~{.php}
box b 0 -10 5 20 20 10 
pcylinder c 5 20 

# intersect the shape, storing results into data structure 
bop b c 

# fuse operation
bopfuse s1 

# cut operation
bopcut s2 

# opposite cut operation
boptuc s3 

# common operation
bopcommon s4 

# section operation
bopsection s5
~~~~


@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_two_bapi bfuse, bcut, btuc, bcommon, bsection

These commands also perform Boolean operations on two shapes. These are the short variants of the bop* commands.
Each of these commands performs both intersection and building the result and may be useful if you need only the result of a single boolean operation.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
bcommon result shape1 shape2 
bfuse result shape1 shape2 
bcut result shape1 shape2 
btuc result shape1 shape2 
~~~~

**bection** command has some additional options for faces intersection:
~~~~{.php}
bsection result shape1 shape2 [-n2d/-n2d1/-n2d2] [-na]
~~~~

Where:
result - result of the operation
shape1, shape2 - arguments of the operation
-n2d - disables PCurve construction on both objects
-n2d1 - disables PCurve construction on first object
-n2d2 - disables PCurve construction on second object
-na - disables approximation of the section curves

@subsection occt_draw_bop_multi Boolean Operations on multiple arguments

The modern Boolean Operations algorithm available in Open CASCADE Technology is capable of performing a Boolean Operations not only on two shapes, but on arbitrary number of shapes.
In terms of Boolean Operations these arguments are divided on two groups **Objects** and **Tools**. The meaning of these groups is similar to the single object and tool of Boolean Operations on two shapes.

The Boolean operations are based on the General Fuse operation (see @ref specification__boolean_7 "General Fuse algorithm") which splits all input shapes basing on the intersection results.
Depending on the type of Boolean operation the BOP algorithm choses the necessary splits of the arguments.

@subsection occt_draw_bop_general_com General commands for working with multiple arguments

The algorithms based on General Fuse operation are using the same commands for adding and clearing the arguments list and for performing intersection of these arguments.

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_general_com_add Adding arguments of operation

The following commands are used to add the objects and tools for Boolean operations:
* **baddobjects** *S1 S2...Sn*	-- adds shapes *S1, S2, ... Sn* as Objects;
* **baddtools** *S1 S2...Sn* -- adds shapes *S1, S2, ... Sn* as Tools;

The following commands are used to clear the objects and tools:
* **bclearobjects** -- clears the list of Objects;
* **bcleartools**	-- clears the list of Tools;

So, when running subsequent operation in one Draw session, make sure you cleared the Objects and Tools from previous operation. Otherwise, the new arguments will be added to the current ones.

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_general_com_fill Intersection of the arguments

The command **bfillds** performs intersection of the arguments (**Objects** and **Tools**) and stores the intersection results into internal Data Structure.


@subsection occt_draw_bop_build Building the result of operations

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_build_BOP Boolean operation

The command **bbop** is used for building the result of Boolean Operation. It has to be used after **bfillds** command.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
bbop result iOp
~~~~

Where:
result - result of the operation
iOp - type of Boolean Operation. It could have the following values:
0 - COMMON operation
1 - FUSE operation
2 - CUT operation
3 - CUT21 (opposite CUT, i.e. objects and tools are swapped) operation
4 - SECTION operation


**Example**
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 5 5 5 10 10 10
box b3 -5 -5 -5 10 10 10

# Clear objects and tools from previous runs
bclearobjects
bcleartools
# add b1 as object
baddobjects b1
# add b2 and b3 as tools
baddtools b2 b3
# perform intersection
bfillds
# build result
bbop rcom 0
bbop rfuse 1
bbop rcut 2
bbop rtuc 3
bbop rsec 4
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_build_GF General Fuse operation

The command **bbuild** is used for building the result of General Fuse Operation. It has to be used after **bfillds** command.
General Fuse operation does not make the difference between Objects and Tools considering both as objects.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
bbuild result
~~~~
**Example**
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 5 5 5 10 10 10
box b3 -5 -5 -5 10 10 10

# Clear objects and tools from previous runs
bclearobjects
bcleartools
# add b1 as object
baddobjects b1
# add b2 and b3 as tools
baddtools b2 b3
# perform intersection
bfillds
# build result
bbuild result
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_build_Split Split operation

Split operation splits the **Objects** by the **Tools**.
The command **bsplit** is used for building the result of Split operation. It has to be used after **bfillds** command.

**Example**
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 5 5 5 10 10 10
box b3 -5 -5 -5 10 10 10

# Clear objects and tools from previous runs
bclearobjects
bcleartools
# add b1 as object
baddobjects b1
# add b2 and b3 as tools
baddtools b2 b3
# perform intersection
bfillds
# build result
bsplit result
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_build_BOP_opensolids Alternative command for BOP

There is an alternative way to build the result of Boolean operation using the **buildbop** command, which should be run after any other building command, such as **bbuild** or **bbop** or **bsplit**.
The command has the following features:
* It is designed to work on open solids and thus uses the alternative approach for building the results (see @ref specification__boolean_bop_on_opensolids "BOP on open solids" chapter of Boolean operations user guide).
* It allows changing the groups of Objects and Tools of the operation (even excluding some of the arguments is possible).
* History information for solids will be lost.

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
buildbop result -o s1 [s2 ...] -t s3 [s4 ...] -op operation (common/fuse/cut/tuc)
~~~~
Where:
result      - result shape of the operation
s1 s2 s3 s4 - arguments (solids) of the GF operation
operation   - type of boolean operation


**Example**
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 5 5 5 10 10 10
box b3 -5 -5 -5 10 10 10

bclearobjects

~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_build_CB Cells Builder

See the @ref specification__boolean_10c_Cells_1 "Cells Builder Usage" for the Draw usage of Cells Builder algorithm.


@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_build_API Building result through API

The following commands are used to perform the operation using API implementation of the algorithms:
* **bapibuild** -- to perform API general fuse operation.
* **bapibop** -- to perform API Boolean operation.
* **bapisplit** -- to perform API Split operation.

These commands have the same syntax as the analogical commands described above.


@subsection occt_draw_bop_options Setting options for the operation

The algorithms in Boolean component have a wide range of options.
To see the current state of all option the command **boptions** should be used.
It has the following syntax:

@subsection occt_draw_bop_check Check commands

The following commands are analyzing the given shape on the validity of Boolean operation.

@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_check_1 bopcheck

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
bopcheck shape [level of check: 0 - 9]
~~~~

It checks the given shape for self-interference. The optional level of check allows limiting the check to certain intersection types. Here are the types of interferences that will be checked for given level of check:
* 0 - only V/V;
* 1 - V/V and V/E;
* 2 - V/V, V/E and E/E;
* 3 - V/V, V/E, E/E and V/F;
* 4 - V/V, V/E, E/E, V/F and E/F;
* 5 - V/V, V/E, E/E, V/F, E/F and F/F;
* 6 - V/V, V/E, E/E, V/F, E/F, F/F and V/S;
* 7 - V/V, V/E, E/E, V/F, E/F, F/F, V/S and E/S;
* 8 - V/V, V/E, E/E, V/F, E/F, F/F, V/S, E/S and F/S;
* 9 - V/V, V/E, E/E, V/F, E/F, F/F, V/S, E/S, F/S and S/S - all interferences (Default value)

**Example:**
~~~~{.php}
box b1 10 10 10
box b2 3 3 3 4 4 4
compound b1 b2 c
bopcheck c
~~~~

In this example one box is completely included into other box. So the output shows that all sub-shapes of b2 interfering with the solid b1.
**bopcheck** command does not modifies the input shape, thus can be safely used.


@subsubsection occt_draw_bop_check_2 bopargcheck

**bopargcheck** syntax:
~~~~{.php}
bopargcheck Shape1 [[Shape2] [-F/O/C/T/S/U] [/R|F|T|V|E|I|P|C|S]] [#BF]

 -<Boolean Operation>
 F (fuse)
 O (common)
 C (cut)
 T (cut21)
 S (section)
 U (unknown)
 For example: "bopargcheck s1 s2 -F" enables checking for Fuse operation
 default - section

 /<Test Options>
 R (disable small edges (shrank range) test)
 F (disable faces verification test)
 T (disable tangent faces searching test)
 V (disable test possibility to merge vertices)
 E (disable test possibility to merge edges)
 I (disable self-interference test)
 P (disable shape type test)
 C (disable test for shape continuity)
 S (disable curve on surface check)
 For example: "bopargcheck s1 s2 /RI" disables small edge detection and self-intersection detection
 default - all options are enabled

 #<Additional Test Options>
 B (stop test on first faulty found); default OFF
 F (full output for faulty shapes); default - output in a short format

 NOTE: <Boolean Operation> and <Test Options> are used only for couple of argument shapes, except I and P options that are always used for couple of shapes as well as for single shape test.
~~~~

As you can see *bopargcheck* performs more extended check of the given shapes than *bopcheck*.

**Example:**
Let's make an edge with big vertices:
~~~~{.php}
vertex v1 0 0 0
settolerance v1 0.5
vertex v2 1 0 0
settolerance v2 0.5
edge e v1 v2
top; don e; fit
tolsphere e

bopargcheck e
~~~~
Here is the output of this command:
~~~~{.php}
Made faulty shape: s1si_1
Made faulty shape: s1se_1
Faulties for FIRST  shape found : 2
---------------------------------
Shapes are not suppotrted by BOP: NO

@section occt_draw_8 Data Exchange commands

This chapter presents some general information about Data Exchange (DE) operations. 

DE commands are intended for translation files of various formats (IGES,STEP) into OCCT shapes with their attributes (colors, layers etc.) 

This files include a number of entities. Each entity has its own number in the file which we call label and denote as # for a STEP file and D for an IGES file. Each file has entities called roots (one or more). A full description of such entities is contained in the Users' Guides 
* for <a href="user_guides__step.html#occt_step_1">STEP format</a> and
* for <a href="user_guides__iges.html#occt_iges_1">IGES format</a>. 

Each Draw session has an interface model, which is a structure for keeping various information. 

The first step of translation is loading information from a file into a model. 
The second step is creation of an OpenCASCADE shape from this model. 

Each entity from a file has its own number in the model (num). During the translation a map of correspondences between labels(from file) and numbers (from model) is created. 

The model and the map are used for working with most of DE commands. 

@subsection occt_draw_8_1  IGES commands 

@subsubsection occt_draw_8_1_1  igesread

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
igesread <file_name> <result_shape_name> [<selection>]
~~~~

Reads an IGES file to an OCCT shape. This command will interactively ask the user to select a set of entities to be converted. 


| N | Mode | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :---------- |
| 0 | End | finish conversion and exit igesbrep |
| 1 | Visible roots | convert only visible roots |
| 2 | All roots | convert all roots |
| 3 | One entity | convert entity with number provided by the user |
| 4 | Selection | convert only entities contained in selection |


After the selected set of entities is loaded the user will be asked how loaded entities should be converted into OCCT shapes (e.g., one shape per root or one shape for all the entities). It is also possible to save loaded shapes in files, and to cancel loading. 

The second parameter of this command defines the name of the loaded shape. If several shapes are created, they will get indexed names. For instance, if the last parameter was *s*, they will be *s_1, ... s_N*. 

<i>\<selection\></i> specifies the scope of selected entities in the model, by default it is *xst-transferrable-roots*.  If we use symbol <i>*</i> as <i>\<selection\></i> all roots will be translated. 

See also the detailed description of <a href="user_guides__iges.html#occt_iges_2_3_4">Selecting IGES entities</a>.

**Example:**
~~~~{.php}
# translation all roots from file 
igesread /disk01/files/model.igs a  * 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_8_1_2   tplosttrim

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
tplosttrim [<IGES_type>] 
~~~~

Sometimes the trimming contours of IGES faces (i.e., entity 141 for 143, 142 for 144) can be lost during translation due to fails. This command gives us a number of lost trims and the number of corresponding IGES entities. 
It outputs the rank and numbers of faces that lost their trims and their numbers for each type (143, 144, 510) and their total number. If a face lost several of its trims it is output only once. 
Optional parameter <i>\<IGES_type\></i> can be *0TrimmedSurface, BoundedSurface* or *Face* to specify the only type of IGES faces. 

**Example:**
~~~~{.php}
tplosttrim TrimmedSurface 
~~~~

@subsubsection occt_draw_8_1_3  brepiges

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
brepiges <shape_name> <filename.igs>
~~~~

Writes an OCCT shape to an IGES file. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
# write shape with name aa to IGES file 
brepiges aa /disk1/tmp/aaa.igs 
== unit (write) : MM 
== mode  write  : Faces 
==    To modify : command  param 
== 1 Shapes written, giving 345 Entities 
==  Now, to write a file, command : writeall filename 
==  Output on file : /disk1/tmp/aaa.igs 
==  Write OK 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_8_2  STEP commands 

These commands are used during the translation of STEP models. 


@subsubsection occt_draw_8_2_1  stepread

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
stepread file_name result_shape_name [selection] 
~~~~

Read a STEP file to an OCCT shape. 
This command will interactively ask the user to select a set of entities to be converted: 

| N | Mode | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |  
| 0 | End | Finish transfer and exit stepread | 
| 1 | root with rank 1 | Transfer first root | 
| 2 | root by its rank | Transfer root specified by its rank | 
| 3 | One entity | Transfer entity with a number provided by the user | 
| 4 | Selection | Transfer only entities contained in selection | 

After the selected set of entities is loaded the user will be asked how loaded entities should be converted into OCCT shapes. 
The second parameter of this command defines the name of the loaded shape. If several shapes are created, they will get indexed names. For instance, if the last parameter was *s*, they will be *s_1, ... s_N*. 
<i>\<selection\></i> specifies the scope of selected entities in the model.  If we use symbol <i>*</i> as <i>\<selection\></i> all roots will be translated. 

See also the detailed description of <a href="user_guides__step.html#occt_step_2_3_6">Selecting STEP entities</a>.

@subsubsection occt_draw_8_3_19  tpstat

Syntax:
~~~~{.php}
tpstat [*|?]<symbol> [<selection>]
~~~~


Provides all statistics on the last transfer, including a list of transferred entities with mapping from IGES or STEP to OCCT types, as well as fail and warning messages. The parameter <i>\<symbol\></i> defines what information will be printed: 

* *g* -- General statistics (a list of results and messages)
* *c* -- Count of all warning and fail messages
* *C* -- List of all warning and fail messages
* *f* -- Count of all fail messages
* *F* -- List of all fail messages
* *n* -- List of all transferred roots
* *s* -- The same, with types of source entity and the type of result
* *b* -- The same, with messages
* *t* -- Count of roots for geometrical types
* *r* -- Count of roots for topological types
* *l* -- The same, with the type of the source entity

The sign \* before parameters *n, s, b, t, r* makes it work on all entities (not only on roots).

The sign ? before *n, s, b, t* limits the scope of information to invalid entities. 

Optional argument \<selection\> can limit the action of the command to the selection, not to all entities. 

To get help, run this command without arguments.

@subsection occt_draw_8_4  Overview of XDE commands 

These commands are used for translation of IGES and STEP files into an XCAF document (special document is inherited from CAF document and is intended for Extended Data Exchange (XDE) ) and working with it. XDE translation allows reading and writing of shapes with additional attributes -- colors, layers etc. All commands can be divided into the following groups: 
  * XDE translation commands
  * XDE general commands
  * XDE shape’s commands
  * XDE color’s commands
  * XDE layer’s commands
  * XDE property’s commands

Reminding: All operations of translation are performed with parameters managed by command @ref occt_draw_8_3_14 "param".

This command illustrates how class *ShapeUpgrade_ShapeDivideContinuity* works. This class allows to convert geometry with a continuity less than the specified continuity to geometry with target continuity. If conversion is not possible then the geometrical object is split into several ones, which satisfy the given tolerance. It also returns the  status shape splitting: 
 * OK      : no splitting was done 
 * Done1 : Some edges were split 
 * Done2 : Surface was split

If the curve had been divided by segments, then each segment is put to an individual result.  This command can correct a given curve at a knot with the given tolerance, if it is impossible, then the given surface is split at that knot. If the last parameter is 1, then 5 knots are added at the given curve, and its surface is split by segments, but this will be performed not for all parametric spaces.

@section occt_draw_11 Extending Test Harness with custom commands


The following chapters explain how to extend Test Harness with custom commands and how to activate them using a plug-in mechanism. 


@subsection occt_draw_11_1 Custom command implementation

Custom command implementation has not undergone any changes since the introduction of the plug-in mechanism. The syntax of every command should still be like in the following example. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.cpp}
static Standard_Integer myadvcurve(Draw_Interpretor& di, Standard_Integer n, char** a) 
{ 
... 
} 
~~~~

For examples of existing commands refer to Open CASCADE Technology (e.g. GeomliteTest.cxx). 


@subsection occt_draw_11_2 Registration of commands in Test Harness

To become available in the Test Harness the custom command must be registered in it. This should be done as follows. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.cpp}
void MyPack::CurveCommands(Draw_Interpretor& theCommands) 
{ 
... 
char* g = "Advanced curves creation"; 

theCommands.Add ( "myadvcurve", "myadvcurve name p1 p2 p3 - Creates my advanced curve from points", 
                  __FILE__, myadvcurve, g ); 
... 
} 
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_11_3 Creating a toolkit (library) as a plug-in

All custom commands are compiled and linked into a dynamic library (.dll on Windows, or .so on Unix/Linux). To make Test Harness recognize it as a plug-in it must respect certain conventions. Namely, it must export function *PLUGINFACTORY()* accepting the Test Harness interpreter object (*Draw_Interpretor*). This function will be called when the library is dynamically loaded during the Test Harness session. 

This exported function *PLUGINFACTORY()* must be implemented only once per library. 

For convenience the *DPLUGIN* macro (defined in the *Draw_PluginMacro.hxx* file) has been provided. It implements the *PLUGINFACTORY()* function as a call to the *Package::Factory()* method and accepts *Package* as an argument. Respectively, this *Package::Factory()* method must be implemented in the library and activate all implemented commands. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.cpp}
#include <Draw_PluginMacro.hxx>

void MyPack::Factory(Draw_Interpretor& theDI)
{
...
// 
MyPack::CurveCommands(theDI);
...
}

// Declare entry point PLUGINFACTORY
DPLUGIN(MyPack)
~~~~

@subsection occt_draw_11_4 Creation of the plug-in resource file

As mentioned above, the plug-in resource file must be compliant with Open CASCADE Technology requirements (see *Resource_Manager.hxx* file for details). In particular, it should contain keys separated from their values by a colon (;:;). 
For every created plug-in there must be a key. For better readability and comprehension it is recommended to have some meaningful name. 
Thus, the resource file must contain a line mapping this name (key) to the library name. The latter should be without file extension (.dll on Windows, .so on Unix/Linux) and without the ;lib; prefix on Unix/Linux. 
For several plug-ins one resource file can be created. In such case, keys denoting plug-ins can be combined into groups, these groups -- into their groups and so on (thereby creating some hierarchy). Any new parent key must have its value as a sequence of child keys separated by spaces, tabs or commas. Keys should form a tree without cyclic dependencies. 

**Examples** (file MyDrawPlugin): 
~~~~{.php}
! Hierarchy of plug-ins 
ALL                : ADVMODELING, MESHING 
DEFAULT            : MESHING 
ADVMODELING        : ADVSURF, ADVCURV 

! Mapping from naming to toolkits (libraries) 
ADVSURF            : TKMyAdvSurf 
ADVCURV            : TKMyAdvCurv 
MESHING            : TKMyMesh 
~~~~

For other examples of the plug-in resource file refer to the @ref occt_draw_1_3_2 "Plug-in resource file" chapter above or to the <i>$CASROOT/src/DrawPlugin</i> file shipped with Open CASCADE Technology. 


@subsection occt_draw_11_5 Dynamic loading and activation

Loading a plug-in and activating its commands is described in the @ref occt_draw_1_3_3 "Activation of the commands implemented in the plug-in" chapter. 

The procedure consists in defining the system variables and using the *pload* commands in the Test Harness session. 

**Example:** 
~~~~{.php}
Draw[]> set env(CSF_MyDrawPluginDefaults) /users/test
Draw[]> pload -MyDrawPlugin ALL
~~~~
