Finding line number information for faults in realtime components

1. Get a version of emc which prints the faulting instruction address
   (that includes this version of emc)

2. Include debugging info in your modules.  For built-in modules,
   below the definition of EXTRA_CFLAGS in Makefile, add
      EXTRA_CFLAGS += -g
   For standalone modules, add the same line just above the line
      ifeq ($(BUILDSYS),kbuild)
   and (re)build the component

3. Run hal until the fault occurs.  DO NOT EXIT THE HAL SESSION YET.  You
   must find the start of the module (step 5) first.

4. Note the ip (instruction pointer) address in dmesg.  e.g.:
      RTAPI: Task 1[c2800000]: Fault with vec=14, signo=11 ip=c93dc01a.
                                                              ^^^^^^^^
5. Make an educated guess about what component it is in, and find the start
   of "text" (program code) for that kernel module:
      $ cat /sys/module/fault/sections/.text
      0xc93dc000
   Now you can exit hal/emc2.

6. Subtract the start of text from the faulting ip (in this case, 0x1a)
   Among other ways to do this, you can use the shell:
      $ printf "0x%x\n" $((0xc93dc01a-0xc93dc000))
      0x1a

7. Use addr2line to find out the source code line:
      $ addr2line -e fault.ko 0x1a
      /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.32-122-rtai/hal/components/fault.comp:9
   Ignore how the directory name is wrong and see whether this has helped you
   localize the problem:
      fault.comp:9          *(int*)0 = 0;
   Yup!  Looks like it has.

   Note that even if you do not prefix the address argument to addr2line
   with 0x, it is taken to be a hex number, and you'll get the wrong
   line-number information.  Take care to always use hex addresses with
   addr2line.
