Basic description
-----------------

The build process follows the standard Linux convention:

From the top level directory, switch to the source directory:

cd src

In the source directory, build EMC2:

./configure
make clean
make
sudo make install

Afterwards you need to issue 'emc' and you'll get emc2 running.

Try-out
-------

If you want only to test the software before installing it,
or if you're worried about overwriting an existing installation, 
there is a Run-In-Place (RIP) mode which you can try out:

From the top level directory, switch to the source directory:

cd src

In the source directory, build EMC2:

./configure --enable-run-in-place
make clean
make
sudo make setuid

to run the software go back to the top level directory, and issue:

scripts/emc


Detailed description
====================


Run-time script
===============

The runtime script is called emc, thus allowing you on an installed to just type
'emc' and get it running.
On a run-in-place system (e.g. the one you just got out of CVS), 
the runscript is emc2/scripts/emc.
When you just checked out a fresh copy of emc2, you'll see there is no 
'scripts/emc', just a 'scripts/emc.in'.
By running configure that one will get changed to 'scripts/emc'. configure will
also replace some default values for your system (folders, paths, etc).


Configure script
================

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile.inc' file.
Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run 
in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `scripts/emc` to test the software. 
  

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure


Optional Features
=================
   EMC is a software that can operate hardware only if a real time system has 
been installed. Either RTLinux or RTAI. If you don't have any installed, you 
cannot run EMC2 to control any machines. Please install one of the RT patches
(refer to the documentation of the project on how to achieve that).

    However, it is possible to test EMC2 without a realtime system. This is 
possible using a simulator mode, which doesn't allow hardware control. To
enable this mode there is a special option '--enable-simulator' you can use.

If you have multiple RTAI or RTLinux source directories in /usr/src,
the correct one can be declared as a command line argument:

./configure --with-rtai=/usr/src/rtai-24.1.12

If you want only to try emc2 in a local directory (without installing it),
there is an option to configure to run-in-place
  --enable-run-in-place                  Enables running in the local dir 
                                         (without installing)

If you don't want to generate the documentation from source:
  --disable-build-documentation          Do not build documentation automatically

configure also accepts other arguments. Use --help to view the list.
 
  --with-rtai=<path to RTAI>              path where RTAI is installed
  --with-rtlinux=<path to RTLINUX>        path where RTLinux is installed
  --with-rtlinuxpro=<path to RTLINUXPRO>  path where RTLinuxPro is installed
  --with-module-dir=<module-dir>          Installation directory for kernel modules
  --with-gtk_ver=<GTK-version>            GTK version
  --with-kbuild=<y/n>                     Specify if your kernel uses kbuild or not
  --with-rmmod=</path/rmmod>              rmmod variant
  --with-insmod=</path/insmod>            insmod variant
  --with-python=<path>                    Specify the Python interpreter
  --with-tclConfig=<path>                 Specify the path to tclConfig
  --with-tkConfig=<path>                  Specify the path to tkConfig
  --with-x                                use the X Window System
  --with-locale-dir=DIR                   Location of the locale file(s)
                                          DATADIR/locale


Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.
