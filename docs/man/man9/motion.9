.SH NAME
motion \- accepts NML motion commands, interacts with HAL in realtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBloadrt motmod [base_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [base_thread_fp=\fI0 or 1\fB] [servo_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [traj_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [num_joints=\fI[1-9]\fB] [num_dio=\fI[1-64]\fB] [num_aio=\fI[1-64]\fB]\fR  \fB[unlock_joints_mask=\fR\fIjointmask\fR\fB]\fR

The maximum number of joints available is set by EMCMOT_MAX_JOINTS.
The maximum number of digital inputs is set by EMCMOT_MAX_DIO.
The maximum number of analog inputs is set by EMCMOT_MAX_AIO.

.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, the base thread does not support floating point.  Software stepping, software encoder counting, and software pwm do not use floating point.  \fBbase_thread_fp\fR can be used to enable floating point in the base thread (for example for brushless DC motor control).

.P
These pins and parameters are created by the realtime \fBmotmod\fR module. This module provides a HAL interface for LinuxCNC's motion planner. Basically \fBmotmod\fR takes in a list of waypoints and generates a nice blended and constraint-limited stream of joint positions to be fed to the motor drives. 

.P
Optionally the number of Digital I/O is set with num_dio. The number of Analog I/O is set with num_aio. The default is 4 each.

.P
Pin names starting with "\fBjoint\fR"  or "\fBaxis\fR" are are read and updated by the motion-controller function.

.SH  AXIS PINS
(\fBL\fR is the axis letter, one of: \fBX Y Z A B C U V W\fR)
.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog-counts\fR IN S32
Connect to the "counts" pin of an external encoder to use a physical jog wheel.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog-enable\fR IN BIT
When TRUE (and in manual mode), any change to "jog-counts" will result in motion. When false, "jog-counts" is ignored.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog-scale\fR IN FLOAT
Sets the distance moved for each count on "jog-counts", in machine units.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog-vel-mode\fR IN BIT
When FALSE (the default), the jogwheel operates in position mode. The axis will move exactly jog-scale units for each count, regardless of how long that might take. When TRUE, the wheel operates in velocity mode - motion stops when the wheel stops, even if that means the commanded motion is not completed.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.pos-cmd\fR OUT FLOAT
The axis commanded position. There may be several offsets between the axis and motor coordinates: backlash compensation, screw error compensation, and home offsets.  External offsets are
reported separately (axis.\fBL\fR.eoffset).

\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.kb-jog-active\fR OUT BIT
(free planner axis jogging active (keyboard or halui))

startup\fR.  If the machine is turned off with an external
offset active, the eoffset-counts pin should be set
to zero before restarting.

machine, the tool, or the work piece).

If the machine is in the middle of a (non-spindle synchronized) move

the commanded position).
