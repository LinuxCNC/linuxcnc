.SH NAME
motion \- accepts NML motion commands, interacts with HAL in realtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBloadrt motmod [base_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [base_thread_fp=\fI0 or 1\fB] [servo_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [traj_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [num_joints=\fI[1-9]\fB] [num_dio=\fI[1-64]\fB] [num_aio=\fI[1-64]\fB]\fR  \fB[unlock_joints_mask=\fR\fIjointmask\fR\fB]\fR

The maximum number of joints available is set by EMCMOT_MAX_JOINTS.
The maximum number of digital inputs is set by EMCMOT_MAX_DIO.
The maximum number of analog inputs is set by EMCMOT_MAX_AIO.

.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, the base thread does not support floating point.  Software stepping, software encoder counting, and software pwm do not use floating point.  \fBbase_thread_fp\fR can be used to enable floating point in the base thread (for example for brushless DC motor control).

.P
These pins and parameters are created by the realtime \fBmotmod\fR module. This module provides a HAL interface for LinuxCNC's motion planner. Basically \fBmotmod\fR takes in a list of waypoints and generates a nice blended and constraint-limited stream of joint positions to be fed to the motor drives. 

.P
Optionally the number of Digital I/O is set with num_dio. The number of Analog I/O is set with num_aio. The default is 4 each.

.P
Pin names starting with "\fBjoint\fR"  or "\fBaxis\fR" are are read and updated by the motion-controller function.

.SH  AXIS PINS
(\fBL\fR is the axis letter, one of: \fBX Y Z A B C U V W\fR)
.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog\-counts\fR IN S32
Connect to the "counts" pin of an external encoder to use a physical jog wheel.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog\-enable\fR IN BIT
When TRUE (and in manual mode), any change to "jog\-counts" will result in motion. When false, "jog\-counts" is ignored.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog\-scale\fR IN FLOAT
Sets the distance moved for each count on "jog\-counts", in machine units.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIL\fB.jog\-accel\-fraction\fR IN FLOAT

is disallowed and an error is reported.  By default, homing is allowed in joint
mode whenever motion is enabled.

.TP
\fBmotion.enable\fR IN BIT

.TP
\fBmotion.feed\-inhibit\fR IN BIT
When this pin is TRUE, machine motion is inhibited (this includes jogs,
programmed feeds, and programmed rapids, aka traverse moves).

If the machine is performing a spindle synchronized move when this
pin goes TRUE, the spindle synchronized motion will finish, and any
following moves will be inhibited (this is to prevent damage to the
machine, the tool, or the work piece).

If the machine is in the middle of a (non-spindle synchronized) move
when this pin goes TRUE, the machine will decelerate to a stop at the
maximum allowed acceleration rate.

Motion resumes when this pin goes FALSE.

the commanded position).

lines while single stepping.

.TP
\fBmotion.requested\-vel\fR OUT FLOAT

the F-word setting from the G-code file, possibly reduced to accomodate
machine velocity and acceleration limits. The value on this pin does
not reflect the feed override or any other adjustments.

Motion will pause until this pin is TRUE, under the following conditions: before the
first feed move after each spindle start or speed change; before the start of every
chain of spindle\-synchronized moves; and if in CSS mode, at every rapid\->feed transition.

was asserted, the spindle\-orient pin is cleared and the spindle\-locked pin is asserted. Also, the spindle\-brake pin is asserted.
