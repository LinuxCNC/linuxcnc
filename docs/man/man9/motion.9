.SH NAME
motion \- accepts NML motion commands, interacts with HAL in realtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBloadrt motmod [base_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [servo_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [traj_period_nsec=\fIperiod\fB] [num_joints=\fI[0-9]\fB] ([num_dio=\fI[1-64]\fB] [num_aio=\fI[1-16]\fB])

.SH DESCRIPTION
These pins and parameters are created by the realtime \fBmotmod\fR module. This module provides a HAL interface for EMC's motion planner. Basically \fBmotmod\fR takes in a list of waypoints and generates a nice blended and constraint-limited stream of joint positions to be fed to the motor drives. 

.P
Optionally the number of Digital I/O is set with num_dio. The number of Analog I/O is set with num_aio. The default is 4 each.

.P
Pin names starting with "\fBaxis\fR" are actually joint values, but the pins and parameters are still called "\fBaxis.\fIN\fR". They are read and updated by the motion-controller function.

.SH PINS

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.amp-enable-out\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE if the amplifier for this joint should be enabled

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.amp-fault-in\fR IN BIT 
Should be driven TRUE if an external fault is detected with the amplifier for this joint

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.home-sw-in\fR IN BIT 
Should be driven TRUE if the home switch for this joint is closed

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.homing\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE if the joint is currently homing

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.index-enable\fR IO BIT 
Should be attached to the index-enable pin of the joint's encoder to enable homing to index pulse

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.is-unlocked\fR IN BIT
If the axis is a locked rotary the unlocked sensor should be connected to this pin

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-counts\fR IN S32 
Connect to the "counts" pin of an external encoder to use a physical jog wheel.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-enable\fR IN BIT 
When TRUE (and in manual mode), any change to "jog-counts" will result in motion. When false, "jog-counts" is ignored.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-scale\fR IN FLOAT 
Sets the distance moved for each count on "jog-counts", in machine units.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.jog-vel-mode\fR IN BIT 
When FALSE (the default), the jogwheel operates in position mode. The axis will move exactly jog-scale units for each count, regardless of how long that might take. When TRUE, the wheel operates in velocity mode - motion stops when the wheel stops, even if that means the commanded motion is not completed.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.joint-pos-cmd\fR OUT FLOAT 
The joint (as opposed to motor) commanded position. There may be several offsets between the joint and motor coordinates: backlash compensation, screw error compensation, and home offsets.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.joint-pos-fb\fR OUT FLOAT 
The joint feedback position. This value is computed from the actual motor position minus joint offsets. Useful for machine visualization.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.motor-pos-cmd\fR OUT FLOAT 
The commanded position for this joint.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.motor-pos-fb\fR IN FLOAT 
The actual position for this joint.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.neg-lim-sw-in\fR IN BIT 
Should be driven TRUE if the negative limit switch for this joint is tripped.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.pos-lim-sw-in\fR IN BIT 
Should be driven TRUE if the positive limit switch for this joint is tripped.

.TP
\fBaxis.\fIN\fB.unlock\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE if the axis is a locked rotary and a move is commaned.

.TP
\fBmotion.adaptive-feed\fR IN FLOAT 
When adaptive feed is enabled with M52 P1, the commanded velocity is multiplied by this value. This effect is multiplicative with the NML-level feed override value and motion.feed-hold.

\fBmotion.distance-to-go\fR OUT FLOAT
Distance remaining in the current move

.TP
\fBmotion.enable\fR IN BIT

\fBmotion.motion-inpos\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE if the machine is in position.

.TP
\fBmotion.probe-input\fR IN BIT 
G38.x uses the value on this pin to determine when the probe has made contact. TRUE for probe contact closed (touching), FALSE for probe contact open.

\fBmotion.program-line\fR OUT S32 

.TP
\fBmotion.requested-vel\fR OUT FLOAT 
The requested velocity with no adjustments for feed override

.TP
\fBmotion.spindle-at-speed\fR IN BIT 
Motion will pause until this pin is TRUE, under the following conditions: before the
first feed move after each spindle start or speed change; before the start of every
chain of spindle-synchronized moves; and if in CSS mode, at every rapid->feed transition.

.TP
\fBmotion.spindle-brake\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE when the spindle brake should be applied

.TP
\fBmotion.spindle-forward\fR OUT BIT 
TRUE when the spindle should rotate forward

.TP
\fBmotion.debug-\fI*\fR 
These values are used for debugging purposes. 
.TP
\fBmotion.servo.last-period\fR

By noting large differences between successive values of motion.servo.last-period, the motion controller can determine that there has probably been a failure to meet its timing constraints. Each time such a failure is detected, this value is incremented.


.SH FUNCTIONS

Generally, these functions are both added to the servo-thread in the order shown.

.TP
\fBmotion-command-handler\fR 
Processes motion commands coming from user space
