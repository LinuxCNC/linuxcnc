.SH DESCRIPTION
Rather than exporting HAL pins and functions, these components provide the
forward and inverse kinematics definitions for emc2.
.SS trivkins \- Trivial Kinematics
There is a 1:1 correspondance between joints and axes.  Most standard milling
machines and lathes use the trivial kinematics module.
.SS rotatekins \- Rotated Kinematics
The X and Y axes are rotated 45 degrees compared to the joints 0 and 1.
.SS tripodkins \- Tripod Kinematics
The joints represent the distance of the controlled point from three predefined
locations (the motors), giving three degrees of freedom in position (XYZ)
.TP
.B tripodkins.Bx
.TQ
.B tripodkins.Cx
.TQ
.B tripodkins.Cy
The location of the three motors is (0,0), (Bx,0), and (Cx,Cy)
.SS genhexkins \- Hexapod Kinematics
Gives six degrees of freedom in position and orientation (XYZABC).  The
location of the motors is defined at compile time.
