.SH DESCRIPTION

hostmot2 is a device driver that interfaces the Mesa HostMot2 firmware
to the LinuxCNC HAL.  This driver by itself does nothing, the boards
that actually run the firmware require their own drivers before anything
can happen.  Currently drivers are available for the 5i20, 5i22, 5i23,
5i25, 3x20, 4i65, and 4i68 (all using the hm2_pci module) and the 7i43
(using the hm2_7i43 module).

The HostMot2 firmware provides modules such as encoders, PWM generators,
step/dir generators, and general purpose I/O pins (GPIOs).  These things are
called "Modules".  The firmware is configured, at firmware compile time,
to provide zero or more instances of each of these Modules.
.SH Board I/O Pins

The HostMot2 firmware runs on an FPGA board.  The board interfaces with
the computer via PCI, PC-104/Plus, or EPP, and interfaces with motion
control hardware such as servos and stepper motors via I/O pins on
the board.

Each I/O pin can be configured, at board-driver load time, to serve
one of two purposes: either as a particular I/O pin of a particular
Module instance (encoder, pwmgen, stepgen etc), or as a general purpose
digital I/O pin.  By default all Module instances are enabled, and all the
board's pins are used by the Module instances.

The user can disable Module instances at board-driver load time, by
specifying a hostmot2 config string modparam.  Any pins which belong to
Module instances that have been disabled automatically become GPIOs.

All IO pins have some HAL presence, whether they belong to an active
module instance or are full GPIOs.  GPIOs can be changed (at run-time)
between inputs, normal outputs, and open drains, and have a flexible
HAL interface.  IO pins that belong to active Module instances are
constrained by the requirements of the owning Module, and have a more
limited interface in HAL.  This is described in the General Purpose
I/O section below.
.SH config modparam

All the board-driver modules (hm2_pci and hm2_7i43) accept a load-time
modparam of type string array, named "config".  This array has one config
string for each board the driver should use.  Each board's config string
is passed to and parsed by the hostmot2 driver when the board-driver
registers the board.

The config string can contain spaces, so it is usually a good idea to
wrap the whole thing in double-quotes (the " character).

The comma character (,) separates members of the config array from
each other.

For example, if your control computer has one 5i20 and one 5i23 you
might load the hm2_pci driver with a HAL command (in halcmd) something
like this:

.B
.nf
loadrt hm2_pci config="firmware=hm2/5i20/SVST8_4.BIT num_encoders=3 num_pwmgens=3 num_stepgens=3,firmware=hm2/5i23/SVSS8_8.BIT sserial_port_0=0000 num_encoders=4"
.fi

Note: this assumes that the hm2_pci driver detects the 5i20 first and
the 5i23 second.  If the detection order does not match the order
of the config strings, the hostmot2 driver will refuse to load the
firmware and the board-driver (hm2_pci or hm2_7i43) will fail to load.
To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to predict the order in
which PCI boards will be detected by the driver, but the detection
order will be consistent as long as PCI boards are not moved around.
Best to try loading it and see what the detection order is.

The format of each board's config string is:

.B [firmware=\fIF\fB] [num_encoders=\fIN\fB] [num_resolvers=\fIN\fB] [num_pwmgens=\fIN\fB] [num_3pwmgens=\fIN\fB] [num_stepgens=\fIN\fB] [sserial_port_0=00000000\fB] [num_leds=\fIN\fB] [enable_raw]
.RS
.TP
\fBfirmware\fR [optional]
Load the firmware specified by F into the FPGA on this board.  If no
"\fBfirmware=\fIF\fR" string is specified, the FPGA will not be
programmed, and had better have a valid configuration already.
 The 5i25 comes pre-programmed with firmware and no "firmware=" string should be
used. It can be loaded, if desired with no config string at all. 
.P
.RS
The requested firmware F is fetched by udev.  udev searches for the
firmware in the system's firmware search path, usually /lib/firmware.
F typically has the form "hm2/<BoardType>/file.bit"; a typical value
for F might be "hm2/5i20/SVST8_4.BIT".  The hostmot2 firmware files are
supplied by the hostmot2-firmware packages, available from linuxcnc.org.
.RE
.TP
\fBnum_encoders\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N encoders.  If N is -1, all encoders are enabled.
If N is 0, no encoders are enabled.  If N is greater than the number of
encoders available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBnum_resolvers\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N resolvers. If N = -1 then all resolvers are enabled.
This module does not work with generic resolvers (unlike the encoder module
which works with any encoder). At the time of writing the  Hostmot2 Resolver
function only works with the Mesa 7i49 card.
.TP
\fBnum_pwmgens\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N pwmgens.  If N is -1, all pwmgens are enabled.
If N is 0, no pwmgens are enabled.  If N is greater than the number of
pwmgens available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBnum_3pwmgens\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N Three-phase pwmgens.  If N is -1, all 3pwmgens
are enabled. If N is 0, no pwmgens are enabled.  If N is greater than the
number of pwmgens available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBnum_stepgens\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N stepgens.  If N is -1, all stepgens are enabled.
If N is 0, no stepgens are enabled.  If N is greater than the number of
stepgens available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBsserial_port_N (N = 0 .. 3)\fR [optional, default: 00000000 for all ports]
Up to 32 Smart Serial devices can be connected to a Mesa Anything IO board
depending on the firmware used and the number of physical connections on the
board. These are arranged in 1-4 ports of 1 to 8 channels.
 Some Smart Serial (SSLBP) cards offer more than one load-time configuration,
for example all inputs, or all outputs, or offering additional analogue input on
some digital pins.
 To set the modes for port 0 use, for example \fBsserial_port_0=0120xxxx\fR
 A '0'in the string sets the corresponding port to mode 0, 1 to mode 1, and so
on up to mode 9. An "x" in any position disables that channel and makes the
corresponding FPGA pins available as GPIO. 
 The string can be up to 8 characters long, and if it defines more
modes than there are channels on the port then the extras are ignored. Channel
numbering is left to right so the example above would set sserial device 0.0
to mode 0, 0.2 to mode2 and disable channels 0.4 onwards. 
 The sserial driver will auto-detect connected devices, no further configuration
should be needed. Unconnected channels will default to GPIO, but the pin values
will vary semi-randomly during boot when card-detection runs, to it is best to 
actively disable any channel that is to be used for GPIO. 
.TP
\fBnum_bspis\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N Buffered SPI drivers. If N is -1 then all the drivers 
are enabled. Each BSPI driver can address 16 devices.
.TP
\fBnum_leds\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N of the LEDs on the FPGA board. If N is -1, then HAL
pins for all the LEDs will be created. If N=0 then no pins will be added.
.TP
\fBenable_raw\fR [optional]
If specified, this turns on a raw access mode, whereby a user can peek and
poke the firmware from HAL.  See Raw Mode below.
.RE
.SH encoder

Encoders have names like "hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.encoder.\fI<Instance>\fR".
"Instance" is a two-digit number that corresponds to the HostMot2 encoder
instance number.  There are 'num_encoders' instances, starting with 00.

So, for example, the HAL pin that has the current position of the second
encoder of the first 5i20 board is: hm2_5i20.0.encoder.01.position (this
assumes that the firmware in that board is configured so that this HAL
object is available)

Each encoder uses three or four input IO pins, depending on how the
firmware was compiled.  Three-pin encoders use A, B, and Index (sometimes
also known as Z).  Four-pin encoders use A, B, Index, and Index-mask.

The hm2 encoder representation is similar to the one described by the
Canonical Device Interface (in the HAL General Reference document),
and to the software encoder component.  Each encoder instance has the
following pins and parameters:

Pins:

.TP
(s32 out) count
Number of encoder counts since the previous reset.

.TP
(float out) position
Encoder position in position units (count / scale).

.TP
(float out) velocity
Estimated encoder velocity in position units
per second.

.TP
(bit in) reset
When this pin is TRUE, the count and position pins are
set to 0.  (The value of the velocity pin is not affected by this.)
The driver does not reset this pin to FALSE after resetting the count
to 0, that is the user's job.

.TP
(bit in/out) index-enable
When this pin is set to True, the count
(and therefore also position) are reset to zero on the next Index
(Phase-Z) pulse.  At the same time, index-enable is reset to zero to
indicate that the pulse has occurred.

.TP
(s32 out) rawcount
Total number of encoder counts since the start,
not adjusted for index or reset.

Parameters:

.TP
(float r/w) scale
Converts from 'count' units to 'position' units.

.TP
(bit r/w) index-invert
If set to True, the rising edge of the Index
input pin triggers the Index event (if index-enable is True).  If set
to False, the falling edge triggers.

.TP
(bit r/w) index-mask
If set to True, the Index input pin only has an
effect if the Index-Mask input pin is True (or False, depending on the
index-mask-invert pin below).

.TP
(bit r/w) index-mask-invert
If set to True, Index-Mask must be False
for Index to have an effect.  If set to False, the Index-Mask pin must
be True.

.TP
(bit r/w) counter-mode
Set to False (the default) for Quadrature.
Set to True for Step/Dir (in which case Step is on the A pin and Dir is
on the B pin).

.TP
(bit r/w) filter
If set to True (the default), the quadrature counter
needs 15 clocks to register a change on any of the three input lines
(any pulse shorter than this is rejected as noise).  If set to False, the
quadrature counter needs only 3 clocks to register a change.  The encoder
sample clock runs at 33 MHz on the PCI AnyIO cards and 50 MHz on the 7i43.

.TP
(float r/w) vel-timeout
When the encoder is moving slower than one
pulse for each time that the driver reads the count from the FPGA (in
the hm2_read() function), the velocity is harder to estimate.  The driver
can wait several iterations for the next pulse to arrive, all the while
reporting the upper bound of the encoder velocity, which can be accurately
guessed.  This parameter specifies how long to wait for the next pulse,
before reporting the encoder stopped.  This parameter is in seconds.

.SH resolver
Resolvers have names like hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.resolver.\fI<Instance>\fR.
<Instance is a 2-digit number, which for the 7i49 board will be between 00 and
05. This function only works with the Mesa Resolver interface boards (of which
the 7i49 is the only example at the time of writing). This board uses an SPI
interface to the FPGA card, and will only work with the correct firmware.
The pins allocated will be listed in the dmesg output, but are unlikely to be
usefully probed with HAL tools.

Pins:

.TP
(float, out) angle
This pin indicates the angular position of the resolver. It
is a number between 0 and 1 for each electrical rotation.

.TP
(float, out) position
Calculated from the number of complete and partial
revolutions since startup, reset, or  index-reset multiplied by the scale
parameter. 

.TP
(float, out) velocity
Calculated from the rotational velocity and the 
velocity-scale parameter. The default scale is electrical rotations per second. 

.TP
(s32, out) count
This pins outputs a simulated encoder count at 2^24
counts per rev (16777216 counts).

.TP
(s32, out) rawcounts
This is identical to the counts pin, except it is not
reset by the 'index' or 'reset' pins. This is the pin which would be linked to
the bldc HAL component if the resolver was being used to commutate a motor.

.TP
(bit, in) reset
Resets the position and counts pins to zero immediately.

.TP
(bit, in/out) index-enable
When this pin is set high the position and counts
pins will be reset the next time the resolver passes through the zero position.
At the same time the pin is driven low to indicate to connected modules that the
index has been seen, and that the counters have been reset.  

.TP
(bit, out) error
Indicates an error in the particular channel. If this value is
"true" then the reported position and velocity are invalid. 

Parameters:
.TP
(float, read/write) scale
The position scale, in machine units per resolver
electrical revolution. 

.TP
(float, read/write) velocity-scale
The conversion factor between resolver
rotation speed and machine velocity. A value of 1 will typically give motor
speed in rps, a value of 0.01666667 will give (approximate) RPM. 

.TP
(float, read/write) excitation-khz
This pin sets the excitation frequency for
the resolver. This pin is module-level rather than instance-level as all
resolvers share the same excitation frequency.
 Valid values are 10 (~10kHz), 5 (~5kHz) and 2.5 (~2.5kHz). The
actual frequency depends on the FPGA frequency, and they correspond to 
CLOCK_LOW/5000, CLOCK_LOW/10000 and CLOCK_LOW/20000 respectively. 
The parameter will be set to the closest available of the three frequencies.
 A value of -1 (the default) indicates that the current setting should be
retained. 


.SH pwmgen

pwmgens have names like "hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.pwmgen.\fI<Instance>\fR".
"Instance" is a two-digit number that corresponds to the HostMot2 pwmgen
instance number.  There are 'num_pwmgens' instances, starting with 00.

So, for example, the HAL pin that enables output from the fourth pwmgen
of the first 7i43 board is: hm2_7i43.0.pwmgen.03.enable (this assumes
that the firmware in that board is configured so that this HAL object
is available)

In HM2, each pwmgen uses three output IO pins: Not-Enable, Out0, and
Out1.

The function of the Out0 and Out1 IO pins varies with output-type
parameter (see below).

The hm2 pwmgen representation is similar to the software pwmgen component.
Each pwmgen instance has the following pins and parameters:

Pins:

.TP
(bit input) enable
If true, the pwmgen will set its Not-Enable pin
false and output its pulses.  If 'enable' is false, pwmgen will set its
Not-Enable pin true and not output any signals.

.TP
(float input) value
The current pwmgen command value, in arbitrary units.

Parameters:

.TP
(float rw) scale
Scaling factor to convert 'value' from arbitrary units
to duty cycle: dc = value / scale.  Duty cycle has an effective range
of -1.0 to +1.0 inclusive, anything outside that range gets clipped.
The default scale is 1.0.

.TP
(s32 rw) output-type
This emulates the output_type load-time argument to
the software pwmgen component.  This parameter may be changed at runtime,
but most of the time you probably want to set it at startup and then leave
it alone.  Accepted values are 1 (PWM on Out0 and Direction on Out1), 2
(Up on Out0 and Down on Out1), 3 (PDM mode, PDM on Out0 and Dir on Out1),
and 4 (Direction on Out0 and PWM on Out1, "for locked antiphase").

In addition to the per-instance HAL Parameters listed above, there are
a couple of HAL Parameters that affect all the pwmgen instances:

.TP
(u32 rw) pwm_frequency
This specifies the PWM frequency, in Hz, of all
the pwmgen instances running in the PWM modes (modes 1 and 2).  This is
the frequency of the variable-duty-cycle wave.  Its effective range is
from 1 Hz up to 193 kHz.  Note that the max frequency is determined by the
ClockHigh frequency of the Anything IO board; the 5i20 and 7i43 both have
a 100 MHz clock, resulting in a 193 kHz max PWM frequency.  Other boards
may have different clocks, resulting in different max PWM frequencies.
If the user attempts to set the frequency too high, it will be clipped
to the max supported frequency of the board.  Frequencies below about
5 Hz are not terribly accurate, but above 5 Hz they're pretty close.
The default pwm_frequency is 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).

.TP
(u32 rw) pdm_frequency
This specifies the PDM frequency, in Hz, of
all the pwmgen instances running in PDM mode (mode 3).  This is the
"pulse slot frequency"; the frequency at which the pdm generator in the
AnyIO board chooses whether to emit a pulse or a space.  Each pulse (and
space) in the PDM pulse train has a duration of 1/pdm_frequency seconds.
For example, setting the pdm_frequency to 2e6 (2 MHz) and the duty cycle
to 50% results in a 1 MHz square wave, identical to a 1 MHz PWM signal
with 50% duty cycle.  The effective range of this parameter is from
about 1525 Hz up to just under 100 MHz.  Note that the max frequency
is determined by the ClockHigh frequency of the Anything IO board; the
5i20 and 7i43 both have a 100 MHz clock, resulting in a 100 Mhz max
PDM frequency.  Other boards may have different clocks, resulting in
different max PDM frequencies.  If the user attempts to set the frequency
too high, it will be clipped to the max supported frequency of the board.
The default pdm_frequency is 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).

.SH 3ppwmgen
Three-Phase PWM generators (3pwmgens) are intended for controlling the high-side
and low-side gates in a 3-phase motor driver. The function is included to
support the Mesa motor controller daughter-cards but can be used to control
an IGBT or similar driver directly.
3pwmgens have names like "hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.3pwmgen.\fI<Instance>\fR"
where <Instance> is a 2-digit number. There will be num_3pwmgens instances,
starting at 00.
Each instance allocates 7 output and one input pins on the Mesa card connectors.
Outputs are: PWM A, PWM B, PWM C, /PWM A, /PWM B, /PWM C, Enable. The first three
pins are the high side drivers, the second three are their complementary low-side
drivers. The enable bit is intended to control the servo amplifier.
The input bit is a fault bit, typically wired to over-current detection. When set
the PWM generator is disabled.
The three phase duty-cycles are individually controllable from -Scale to +Scale.
Note that 0 corresponds to a 50% duty cycle and this is the inialization value.

Pins:

(float input) A-value, B-value, C-value: The PWM command value for each phase,
limited to +/- "scale". Defaults to zero which is 50% duty cycle on high-side and
low-sidepins (but see the "deadtime" parameter)

.TP
(bit input) enable
When high the PWM is enabled as long as the fault bit is not
set by the external fault input pin. When low the PWM is disabled, with both high-
side and low-side drivers low. This is not the same as 0 output (50% duty cycle on
both sets of pins) or negative full scale (where the low side drivers are "on"
100% of the time)

.TP
(bit output) fault
Indicates the status of the fault bit. This output latches high
once set by the physical fault pin until the "enable" pin is set to high.

Parameters:

.TP
(u32 rw) deadtime
Sets the dead-time between the high-side driver turning off and
the low-side driver turning on and vice-versa. Deadtime is subtracted from on time
and added to off time symmetrically. For example with 20 kHz PWM (50 uSec period),
50% duty cycle and zero dead time, the PWM and NPWM outputs would be square
waves (NPWM being inverted from PWM) with high times of 25 uS. With the same
settings but 1 uS of deadtime, the PWM and NPWM outputs would both have high
times of 23 uS (25 - (2X 1 uS), 1 uS per edge).
The value is specified in nS and defaults to a rather conservative 5000nS. Setting
this parameter to too low a value could be both expensive and dangerous as if both
gates are open at the same time there is effectively a short circuit accross the
supply.

.TP
(float rw) scale
Sets the half-scale of the specified 3-phase PWM generator.
PWM values from -scale to +scale are valid. Default is +/- 1.0

.TP
(bit rw) fault-invert
Sets the polarity of the fault input pin. A value of 1 means
that a fault is triggered with the pin high, and 0 means that a fault it triggered
when the pin is pulled low. Default 0, fault = low so that the PWM works with the
fault pin unconnected.

.TP
(u32 rw) sample-time
Sets the time during the cycle when an ADC pulse
is generated.  0 = start of PWM cycle and 1 = end. Not currently useful
to LinuxCNC. Default 0.5.

In addition the per-instance parameters above there is the following parameter
that affects all instances

.TP
(u32 rw) frequency
Sets the master PWM frequency. Maximum is approx 48kHz, minimum
is 1kHz. Defaults to 20kHz.


.SH stepgen

stepgens have names like "hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.stepgen.\fI<Instance>\fR".
"Instance" is a two-digit number that corresponds to the HostMot2 stepgen
instance number.  There are 'num_stepgens' instances, starting with 00.

So, for example, the HAL pin that has the current position
feedback from the first stepgen of the second 5i22 board is:
hm2_5i22.1.stepgen.00.position-fb (this assumes that the firmware in
that board is configured so that this HAL object is available)

Each stepgen uses 2 IO pins.  The signals on these pins depends on the
step_type parameter (described below).

The stepgen representation is modeled on the stepgen software component.
Each stepgen instance has the following pins and parameters:

Pins:

.TP
(float input) position-cmd
Target position of stepper motion, in
arbitrary position units.  This pin is only used when the stepgen is in
position control mode (control-type=0).

.TP
(float input) velocity-cmd
Target velocity of stepper motion, in
arbitrary position units per second.  This pin is only used when the
stepgen is in velocity control mode (control-type=1).

.TP
(s32 output) counts
Feedback position in counts (number of steps).

.TP
(float output) position-fb
Feedback position in arbitrary position
units.  This is similar to "counts/position_scale", but has finer than
step resolution.

.TP
(float output) velocity-fb
Feedback velocity in arbitrary position
units per second.

.TP
(bit input) enable
This pin enables the step generator instance.
When True, the stepgen instance works as expected.  When False, no steps
are generated and velocity-fb goes immediately to 0.  If the stepgen is
moving when enable goes false it stops immediately, without obeying the
maxaccel limit.

.TP
(bit input) control-type
Switches between position control mode (0)
and velocity control mode (1).  Defaults to position control (0).

Parameters:

.TP
(float r/w) position-scale
Converts from counts to position units.
position = counts / position_scale

.TP
(float r/w) maxvel
Maximum speed, in position units per second.  If set
to 0, the driver will always use the maximum possible velocity based
on the current step timings and position-scale.  The max velocity will
change if the step timings or position-scale changes.  Defaults to 0.

.TP
(float r/w) maxaccel
Maximum acceleration, in position units per second
per second.  Defaults to 1.0.  If set to 0, the driver will not limit its
acceleration at all - this requires that the position-cmd or velocity-cmd
pin is driven in a way that does not exceed the machine's capabilities.
This is probably what you want if you're going to be using the LinuxCNC
trajectory planner to jog or run G-code.

.TP
(u32 r/w) steplen
Duration of the step signal, in nanoseconds.

.TP
(u32 r/w) stepspace
Minimum interval between step signals, in
nanoseconds.

.TP
(u32 r/w) dirsetup
Minimum duration of stable Direction signal before
a step begins, in nanoseconds.

.TP
(u32 r/w) dirhold
Minimum duration of stable Direction signal after a
step ends, in nanoseconds.

.TP
(u32 r/w) step_type
Output format, like the step_type modparam to the
software stegen(9) component.  0 = Step/Dir, 1 = Up/Down, 2 = Quadrature.
In Quadrature mode (step_type=2), the stepgen outputs one complete Gray
cycle (00 -> 01 -> 11 -> 10 -> 00) for each "step" it takes.

.SH Smart Serial Interface

The Smart Serial Interface allows up to 32 different devices such as the Mesa
8i20 2.2kW 3-phase drive or 7i64 48-way IO cards to be connected to a single
FPGA card.
The driver auto-detects the connected hardware port, channel and device type.
Devices can be connected in any order to any active channel of an active port.
(see the config modparam definition above).

In addition to the per-channel/device pins detailed below there are three
per-port pins, three parameters and a further 7 pins shared between all ports
used for changing on-device settings.

Pins:

(bit, in) .sserial.port-N.run: Enables the specific Smart Serial module.
Setting this pin low will disable all boards on the port and puts the port in a
pass-through mode where device parameter setting is possible.
This pin defaults to TRUE and can be left unconnected. However, toggling the pin
low-to-high will re-enable a faulted drive so the pin could usefully be
connected to the iocontrol.0.user-enable-out pin.

(u32, ro) .run_state: Shows the state of the sserial communications state-machine.
This pin will generally show a value of 0x03 in normal operation, 0x07 in
setup mode and 0x00 when the "run" pin is false.

(u32, ro) .error-count: Indicates the state of the Smart Serial error handler, 
see the parameters sections for more details. 

(u32, in) .sserial.port: When programming device parameters, this pin sets the
active port.

(u32, in) .sserial.channel: This sets the active channel on the port defined
above.

(u32, in) .sserial.parameter: The two LSBs of this pin determine the parameter
address on the device connected to the channel and port defined above which will
be read from or written to. Byte 2 is used to pass the data type for
non-volatile writes, and byte 3 passes the access type flags. For example 
0xEC010002 is the code to use to set 8i20 NVMAXCURRENT.

(u32, in) .sserial.value: This pin is used to set the value to be written to a
device parameter. It can also be used to read-back a value from the device, but
as it is an input pin the read-back value is only useful to humans.

(bit, in) .sserial.read: Starts the parameter read cycle. On completion the pin
will return to zero (if not connected in HAL)

(bit, in) .sserial.write: Starts the parameter write cycle. On completion the
pin will return to zero (if not connected in HAL)

(u32, out) .sserial.state: Shows the state of the read or write process (which
typically takes many servo cycles). See the source code if the precise meanings
are important to your application.

Parameters:

(u32 r/w) .fault-inc: Any over-run or handshaking error in the SmartSerial
communications will increment the .fault-count pin by the amount specified by
this parameter. Default = 10.

(u32 r/w) .fault-dec: Every successful read/write cycle decrements the fault
counter by this amount. Default = 1.

(u32 r/w) .fault-lim: When the fault counter reaches this threshold the Smart
Serial interface on the corresponding port will be stopped and an error printed 
in dmesg. Together these three pins allow for control over the degree of fault-
tolerance allowed in the interface. The default values mean that if more than
one transaction in ten fails, more than 20 times, then a hard error will be
raised. If the increment were to be set to zero then no error would ever be
raised, and the system would carry on regardless. Conversely setting decrement to 
zero, threshold to 1 and limit to 1 means that absolutely no errors will be
tolerated. (This structure is copied directly from vehicle ECU practice)

The other pins and parameters created in HAL depend on the devices detected.
.TP
.SH \fB8i20\fR
The 8i20 is a 2.2kW three-phase drive for brushless DC motors and AC servo
motors.
8i20 pins and parameters have names like
"hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.8i20.\fI<PortNum>\fR.\fI<ChanNum>\fR.\fI<Pin>\fR", for example
"hm2_5i23.0.8i20.1.3.current" would set the phase current for the drive
connected to the fourth channel of the second sserial port of the first 5i23
board. Note that the sserial ports do not necessarily correlate in layout or
number to the physical ports on the card.

Pins:

.TP
(bit, in) amp-enable
Set this pin high to enable the drive. With the pin low
communications are active but the phase angle and current are set to zero.

.TP
(float in) angle
The rotor angle of the motor in fractions of a full
\fBphase\fR revolution. An angle of 0.5 indicates that the motor is half a turn
/ 180 degrees / \[*p] radians from the zero position. The zero position is taken to
be the position that the motor adopts under no load with a poitive voltage
applied to the A (or U) phase and both B and C (or V and W) connected to -V or
0V. A 6 pole motor will have 3 zero positions per physical rotation. Note that
the 8i20 drive automatically adds the phase lead/lag angle, and that this pin
should see the raw rotor angle. There is a HAL module (bldc) which handles the
complexity of differing motor and drive types.

.TP
(float, in) current
The phase current command to the drive. This is scaled
from -1 to +1 for forwards and reverse maximum currents. The absolute value of
the current is set by the max_current parameter.

.TP
(float, ro) voltage
The drive bus voltage in V. This will tend to show 25.6V
when the drive is unpowered and the drive will not operate below about 50V.

.TP
(float, ro) temp
The temperature of the driver in degrees C.

.TP
(u32, ro) fault
The fault status of the drive. See the 8i20 manual for a
detailed description.

.TP
(u32, ro) status
The operating status of the drive. See the 8i20 manual for
more details.

.TP
(u32, ro) comms
The communication status of the drive. See the manual for
more details.

Parameters:

.TP
(float, rw) max_current
Sets the maximum drive current in Amps. The default
value is the maximum current programmed into the drive EEPROM. The value must be
positive, and an error will be raised if a current in excess of the drive
maximum is requested.

.TP
(u32, ro) serial_number
The serial number of the connected drive. This is
also shown on the label on the drive.
.TP
.SH \fB 7i64\fR
The 7i64 is a 24-input 24-output IO card.
7i64 pins and parameters have names like "hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.7i64.
<PortNum>.<ChanNum>.<Pin>", for example hm2_5i23.0.7i63.1.3.digout.01.out

Pins:
(bit, in) .digout.NN.out: Writing a 1 or TRUE to this pin will enable output
driver NN. Note that the outputs are drivers (switches) rather than voltage
outputs. The LED adjacent to the connector on the board shows the status.

(bit, out) .digin.NN.in: The value of input NN. Note that the inputs are
isolated and both pins of each input must be connected (typically to signal and
the ground of the signal. This need not be the ground of the board.)

(bit, out) .digin.NN.in-not: An inverted copy of the corresponding input.

(float, out) .adcin.00.in & .adcin.01.in: The two analogue inputs (0 to 3.3V) on
the board.

Parameters:
(bit, rw) .digout.NN.invert: Setting this parameter to 1 / TRUE will invert
the output value, such that writing 0 to .gpio.NN.out will enable the output
and vice-versa.

.SH BSPI
The BSPI (Buffered SPI) driver is unusual in that it does not create any HAL
pins. Instead the driver exports a set of functions that can be used by a sub
-driver for the attached hardware. Typically these would be written in the "comp"
pre-processing language: see http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/hal_comp.html or man
comp for further details. See man mesa_7i65 and the source of mesa_7i65.comp for
details of a typical sub-driver.
See man hm2_bspi_setup_chan, man hm2_bspi_write_chan, man hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame,
man hm2_allocate_bspi_tram, man hm2_bspi_set_read_funtion and
man hm2_bspi_set_write_function for the exported functions.

The names of the available channels are printed to standard output during the
driver loading process and take the form
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0
.SH General Purpose I/O

I/O pins on the board which are not used by a module instance are exported
to HAL as "full" GPIO pins.  Full GPIO pins can be configured at run-time
to be inputs, outputs, or open drains, and have a HAL interface that
exposes this flexibility.  IO pins that are owned by an active module
instance are constrained by the requirements of the owning module,
and have a restricted HAL interface.

GPIOs have names like "hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.gpio.\fI<IONum>\fR".
IONum is a three-digit number.  The mapping from IONum to connector and
pin-on-that-connector is written to the syslog when the driver loads,
and it's documented in Mesa's manual for the Anything I/O boards.

So, for example, the HAL pin that has the current inverted input value
read from GPIO 012 of the second 7i43 board is: hm2_7i43.1.gpio.012.in-not
(this assumes that the firmware in that board is configured so that this
HAL object is available)

The HAL parameter that controls whether the last GPIO of the first 5i22
is an input or an output is: hm2_5i22.0.gpio.095.is_output (this assumes
that the firmware in that board is configured so that this HAL object
is available)

The hm2 GPIO representation is modeled after the Digital Inputs and
Digital Outputs described in the Canonical Device Interface (part of
the HAL General Reference document).  Each GPIO can have the following
HAL Pins:

(bit out) in & in_not: State (normal and inverted) of the hardware
input pin.  Both full GPIO pins and IO pins used as inputs by active
module instances have these pins.

.TP
(bit in) out
Value to be written (possibly inverted) to the hardware
output pin.  Only full GPIO pins have this pin.

Each GPIO can have the following Parameters:

.TP
(bit r/w) is_output
If set to 0, the GPIO is an input.  The IO pin
is put in a high-impedance state (weakly pulled high), to be driven by
other devices.  The logic value on the IO pin is available in the "in" and
"in_not" HAL pins.  Writes to the "out" HAL pin have no effect.  If this
parameter is set to 1, the GPIO is an output; its behavior then depends
on the "is_opendrain" parameter.  Only full GPIO pins have this parameter.

.TP
(bit r/w) is_opendrain
This parameter only has an effect if the
"is_output" parameter is true.  If this parameter is false, the GPIO
behaves as a normal output pin: the IO pin on the connector is driven
to the value specified by the "out" HAL pin (possibly inverted), and the
value of the "in" and "in_not" HAL pins is undefined.  If this parameter
is true, the GPIO behaves as an open-drain pin.  Writing 0 to the "out"
HAL pin drives the IO pin low, writing 1 to the "out" HAL pin puts the
IO pin in a high-impedance state.  In this high-impedance state the IO
pin floats (weakly pulled high), and other devices can drive the value;
the resulting value on the IO pin is available on the "in" and "in_not"
pins.  Only full GPIO pins and IO pins used as outputs by active module
instances have this parameter.

.TP
(bit r/w) invert_output
This parameter only has an effect if the
"is_output" parameter is true.  If this parameter is true, the output
value of the GPIO will be the inverse of the value on the "out" HAL pin.
Only full GPIO pins and IO pins used as outputs by active module instances
have this parameter.

.SH led

Creates HAL pins for the LEDs on the FPGA board.

Pins:

.TP
(bit in) CR<NN>
The pins are numbered from CR01 upwards with the name
corresponding to the PCB silkscreen. Setting the bit to "true" or 1 lights
the led.

.SH Watchdog

The HostMot2 firmware may include a watchdog Module; if it does, the
hostmot2 driver will use it.  The HAL representation of the watchdog is
named "hm2_\fB<BoardType>\fR.\fB<BoardNum>\fR.watchdog".

The watchdog starts out asleep and inactive.  Once you access the board
the first time by running any the hm2 HAL functions read(), write(),
or pet_watchdog() (see below), the watchdog wakes up.  From them on
it must be petted periodically or it will bite.  Pet the watchdog by
running the pet_watchdog() HAL function.

When the watchdog bites, all the board's I/O pins are disconnected from
their Module instances and become high-impedance inputs (pulled high),
and all communication with the board stops.  The state of the HostMot2
firwmare modules is not disturbed (except for the configuration of the
IO Pins).  Encoder instances keep counting quadrature pulses, and pwm-
and step-generators keep generating signals (which are *not* relayed to
the motors, because the IO Pins have become inputs).

Resetting the watchdog (by clearing the has_bit pin, see below) resumes
communication and resets the I/O pins to the configuration chosen at
load-time.

If the firmware includes a watchdog, the following HAL objects will
be exported:

Pins:

.TP
(bit in/out) has_bit
True if the watchdog has bit, False if the watchdog has
not bit.  If the watchdog has bit and the has_bit bit is True, the user
can reset it to False to resume operation.

Parameters:

.TP
(u32 read/write) timeout_ns
Watchdog timeout, in nanoseconds.  This is
initialized to 5,000,000 (5 milliseconds) at module load time.  If more
than this amount of time passes between calls to the pet_watchdog()
function, the watchdog will bite.

Functions:

pet_watchdog(): Calling this function resets the watchdog timer
(postponing the watchdog biting until timeout_ns nanoseconds later).
.SH Raw Mode

If the "enable_raw" config keyword is specified, some extra debugging
pins are made available in HAL.  The raw mode HAL pin names begin with
"hm2_\fI<BoardType>\fR.\fI<BoardNum>\fR.raw".

With Raw mode enabled, a user may peek and poke the firmware from HAL,
and may dump the internal state of the hostmot2 driver to the syslog.

Pins:

.TP
(u32 in) read_address
The bottom 16 bits of this is used as the address
to read from.

.TP
(u32 out) read_data
Each time the hm2_read() function is called, this
pin is updated with the value at .read_address.

.TP
(u32 in) write_address
The bottom 16 bits of this is used as the address
to write to.

.TP
(u32 in) write_data
This is the value to write to .write_address.

.TP
(bit in) write_strobe
Each time the hm2_write() function is called, this
pin is examined.  If it is True, then value in .write_data is written
to the address in .write_address, and .write_strobe is set back to False.

.TP
(bit in/out) dump_state
This pin is normally False.  If it gets set to
True the hostmot2 driver will write its representation of the board's
internal state to the syslog, and set the pin back to False.

.SH Setting up Smart Serial devices 

If a Smart Serial port is stopped, it is then possible to read and set the 
onboard firmware settings using "setp" commands from within halrun or with
halcmd. The hostmot read function needs to be attached to a realtime thread to
allow parameters to be read and set, but the write thread is not needed.
A typical command-line sequence to read the max current setting of an 8i20 on 
channel 1 of port 0 would be:

$>halrun

 halcmd: loadrt hostmot2
 halcmd: loadrt hm2_pci config="firmware=hm2/5i23/svss8_44 sserial_port_0=x0xxxxxxx"
 halcmd: loadrt threads
 halcmd: addf hm2_5i23.0.read thread1
 halcmd: addf hm2_5i23.0.write thread1
 halcmd: start
 halcmd: setp hm2_5i23.0.sserial.0.port-0.run 0
 halcmd: setp hm2_5i23.0.sserial.0.port 0
 halcmd: setp hm2_5i23.0.sserial.0.channel 1
 halcmd: setp hm2_5i23.0.sserial.0.0.parameter 0x8e8
 halcmd: setp hm2_5i23.0.sserial.0.0.read 1
 halcmd: show pin hm2_5i23.0.sserial.0.0.value

It is not expected that this would be a frequent task.
The pin descriptions appear earlier in this document. 

.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
\fBhm2_\fI<BoardType>\fB.\fI<BoardNum>\fB.read\fR
This reads the encoder counters, stepgen feedbacks, and GPIO input pins
from the FPGA.
.TP
\fBhm2_\fI<BoardType>\fB.\fI<BoardNum>\fB.write\fR
This updates the PWM duty cycles, stepgen rates, and GPIO outputs on
the FPGA.  Any changes to configuration pins such as stepgen timing,
GPIO inversions, etc, are also effected by this function.
.TP
\fBhm2_\fI<BoardType>\fB.\fI<BoardNum>\fB.pet-watchdog\fR
Pet the watchdog to keep it from biting us for a while.
.TP
\fBhm2_\fI<BoardType>\fB.\fI<BoardNum>\fB.read_gpio\fR
Read the GPIO input pins.  Note that the effect of this function is a
subset of the effect of the .read() function described above.  Normally
only .read() is used.  The only reason to call this function is if you
want to do GPIO things in a faster-than-servo thread.  (This function
is not available on the 7i43 due to limitations of the EPP bus.)
.TP
\fBhm2_\fI<BoardType>\fB.\fI<BoardNum>\fB.write_gpio\fR
Write the GPIO control registers and output pins.  Note that the effect of
this function is a subset of the effect of the .write() function described
above.  Normally only .write() is used.  The only reason to call this
function is if you want to do GPIO things in a faster-than-servo thread.
(This function is not available on the 7i43 due to limitations of the
EPP bus.)
