single quotes.

Images
======
put all images in the images subdirectory

image::<target>[<attributes>]

example
image::images/axis.png[]
image::images/tiger.png["Tiger image",align="center"]

If the image is small and displays too big in the pdf you can
use the scaledwidth="60%" attribute

=============
Same as images except only one : is used and no attributes are used between 
the []

My text has an image in it image:images/axisbutton.png[]

Figures
=======
Use the following format for figures so any links to the anchor will move to
correct place. Only create a link to a figure if it is somewhere else and not 
the next thing you see when scrolling down. Just say something like "in the 
following figure..."

[[fig:Parport-block-diag]]

they will print as normal characters.

Latexmath is broken at the moment and trashes the HTML. A work around is to use open office math
to create the math image and gimp to screen capture and save to a png.

check asciidoc cheatsheet http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc or user manual
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html for details about format.
