[[sub:torpodeos]]

<<sub:torpodeos,bombs>>

only bombs will show in the text with an underline so always provide a caption for a link

AsciiDoc Formatting
--------------------
Listing Block for G Code and terminal output
---- < 4 dashes start of block
lines of code
...
more code
---- < 4 dashes end of block
     < 1 blank line after

just as you type it.
.... < 4 periods end the block
     < 1 blank line after

** bullet

. numbered
.. numbered

List Item Continuation
* List item paragaph one
  continued with a single plus hard left.
+
List item one continued 
   with a second paragraph
   and first line of second paragraph must be hard left.
     
Images

put all images in the images subdirectory

image::<target>[<attributes>]

example
image::images/axis.png[]
image::images/tiger.png["Tiger image",align="center"]

If the image is small and displays too big in the pdf you can
use the scaledwidth="60%" attribute

Escaping a character.
Normally characters like ' and * would not print unless you use \' or \* then
they will print as normal characters.

Making a horizontal labeled list.
[horizontal]
Label:: The text about the label

Latexmath is broken at the moment and trashes the HTML. A work around is to use open office math
to create the math image and gimp to screen capture and save to a png.
