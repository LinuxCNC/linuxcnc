"It is not good practice to program radius format arcs that are nearly full "
"circles or nearly semicircles because a small change in the location of the "
"end point will produce a much larger change in the location of the center of "
"the circle (and, hence, the middle of the arc). The magnification effect is "
"large enough that rounding error in a number can produce out-of-tolerance "
"cuts. For instance, a 1% displacement of the endpoint of a 180 degree arc "
"produced a 7% displacement of the point 90 degrees along the arc. Nearly "
"full circles are even worse. Other size arcs (in the range tiny to 165 "
"degrees or 195 to 345 degrees) are OK."
msgstr ""
"Ce n'est pas une bonne pratique de programmer au format rayon des arcs qui "

"milieu de l'arc). L'effet de grossissement est tellement important, qu'une "
"erreur d'arrondi peut facilement produire un usinage hors tolérance. Par "
"exemple, 1% de déplacement de l'extrémité d'un arc de 180 degrés produit 7% "
"de déplacement du point situé à 90 degrés le long de l'arc. Les cercles "

"We are almost ready to start our HAL system. However we still need to adjust "
"a few parameters. By default, the siggen component generates signals that "
"swing from +1 to -1. For our example that is fine, we want the table speed "
"to vary from +1 to -1 inches per second. However the scaling of the step "
"pulse generator isn't quite right. By default, it generates an output "
"frequency of 1 step per second with an input of 1.000. It is unlikely that "
"one step per second will give us one inch per second of table movement. "
"Let's assume instead that we have a 5 turn per inch leadscrew, connected to "
"a 200 step per rev stepper with 10x microstepping. So it takes 2000 steps "
"for one revolution of the screw, and 5 revolutions to travel one inch. that "
"means the overall scaling is 10000 steps per inch. We need to multiply the "
"velocity input to the step pulse generator by 10000 to get the proper "
"output. That is exactly what the parameter 'stepgen.n.velocity-scale' is "
"for. In this case, both the X and Y axis have the same scaling, so we set "
"the scaling parameters for both to 10000."

"nous voulons que la vitesse de la table varie de +1 à -1 pouce par seconde. "
"Toutefois, l'échelle du générateur d'impulsions de pas n'est pas bonne. Par "

"notre vis fasse 5 tours par pouce, couplée à un moteur pas à pas de 200 pas "
"par tour et une interface qui fournit 10 micropas par pas. Il faut donc 2000 "
"pas pour faire un tour de vis et 5 tours pour faire un pouce. Ce qui "
"signifie que notre montage utilisera 10000 pas par pouce. Nous avons besoin "
"de multiplier la vitesse d'entrée à l'étape générateur d'impulsions par "
"10000 pour obtenir la bonne valeur. C'est exactement pour cela qu'existe le "

"Ladder logic or the Ladder programming language is a method of drawing "
"electrical logic schematics. It is now a graphical language very popular for "
"programming Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). It was originally "
"invented to describe logic made from relays. The name is based on the "
"observation that programs in this language resemble ladders, with two "
"vertical 'rails' and a series of horizontal 'rungs' between them. In Germany "
"and elsewhere in Europe, the style is to draw the rails horizontally along "
"the top and bottom of the page while the rungs are drawn vertically from "
"left to right."
