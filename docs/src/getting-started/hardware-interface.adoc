[[cha:hardware-interface]]
= Hardware Interface(((Hardware Interface)))

= Hardware to run the LinuxCNC software
A computer is required to run LinuxCNC itself. See <<cha:system-requirements,Computer System Requirements>>

The most common is to use a x86 computer (standard Intel / AMD computer)

ARM computers such as the Raspberry Pi or Orange Pi can be used

= Hardware Interface to CNC machine
An interface is necessary to transmit (and convert) signals and information between LinuxCNC (the software on the computer) and CNC hardware (such as stepper / servo drivers, limit switches, inputs and outputs etc.). There are multiple different ways to interface.

Interfaces include:
- Parallel Port
- Ethernet
- EtherCAT
- PCI / PCIe
- SPI (where the computer has a native SPI interface, such as Raspberry Pi)
- USB (_not_ realtime interface)

A mix of different interfaces can be used. For example, a combination of ethercat for servo drives, and parallel port for additional General Purpose Inputs / Outputs (GPIO)

Some of these solutions are usable for all aspects of hardware interfacing, and some have specific roles (e.g. non-realtime GPIO for an operator interface with switches).

Hardware interface options change over time. This list is not a 100% complete list of all hardware interfaces that can be used with LinuxCNC.

== Parallel Port
Using onboard motherboard parallel port, or a PCI/PCIe parallel port card.

== Parallel Port Software Interface
Realtime (time critical) tasks such as step generation are done in software on the LinuxCNC host - this means the parallel port interface is much more sensitive to the LinuxCNC computer's latency.

__Advantages:__
- Low cost
- Simple configuration

__Disadvantages:__
- Sensitive to the LinuxCNC computer's latency
- Limited inputs/outputs
- Some PCI/PCIe parallel port cards do not work well or do not properly support the EPP mode (EPP mode is required for parallel port interface to Mesa / PICO cards).


== Parallel Port FPGA Communication
Realtime (time critical) tasks such as step generation are done in hardware (not on the computer)

=== Mesa via Parallel Port
Mesa use Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) interfaced via parallel port - e.g. 7i43

=== Pico Systems via Parallel Port

== Ethernet
=== Mesa Ethernet
Mesa cards with a Field-programmable gate array (FPGA), interfaced to LinuxCNC computer via Ethernet. Time critical (realtime) tasks are performed on the FPGA card.

Multiple ethernet interface FPGA cards are available, with many expansion cards

=== Remora Ethernet
Realtime requirements are offloaded onto a controller board. Multiple different controller boards are supported - see https://remora-docs.readthedocs.io[Remora docs].

Note that some of these controller boards (e.g. NVEM, EC300, EC500) are designed / sold for use with Mach3. Use with LinuxCNC requires flashing new firmware, which has been developed by the LinuxCNC community. The manufacturer does not support LinuxCNC.

Expatria Technologies PicoBOB-DLX was designed for LinuxCNC Remora.

=== Litex-CNC
This project aims to make a generic CNC firmware and driver for FPGA cards which are supported by LiteX. Configuration of the board and driver is done using json-files. The supported boards are the Colorlight boards 5A-75B and 5A-75E, as these are fully supported with the open source toolchain.

Colorlight 5A-75B and 5A-75E cards are designed as a LED receiver card - it outputs to LED matrix panels. These cards have outputs only - hardware modification is required to enable use for inputs. Soldering required. Output buffers can be replaced with an input buffer.

=== LinuxCNC-RIO
RealtimeIO for LinuxCNC based on an FPGA

Ethernet interface can be used with a Ethernet to SPI interface.

== EtherCAT
Beckhoff EtherCAT(TM) and compatible systems can be made to work with LinuxCNC using the open source etherlab software.

EtherCAT is the open real-time Ethernet network originally developed by Beckhoff.
The EtherCAT master (LinuxCNC computer) uses a standard ethernet (network) interface - no special hardware is needed on the master. The slaves use special hardware.
There are many EtherCAT slave devices available including servo drives, stepper drives, input, output interfaces, VFDs, and others.

SPI = Serial Peripheral Interface. SPI interfaces can be found on single board computers like Raspberry Pi, or Orange Pi. SPI interface is _not_ generally present on standard computers (AMD/Intel).
