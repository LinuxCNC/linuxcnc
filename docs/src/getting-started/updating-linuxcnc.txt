= Updating LinuxCNC

This section describes how to upgrade LinuxCNC to version 2.7 from
version 2.6. It assumes that you have an existing 2.6 install that you
want to update to 2.7.

To upgrade LinuxCNC to version 2.7 from a version older than 2.6, you have to
first link:http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UpdatingTo2.6[upgrade to 2.6]
, then follow these instructions to upgrade to 2.7.

If you do not have an old (pre-2.7) version of LinuxCNC to upgrade,
then you're best off making a fresh install of 2.7 as described in the
section <<cha:getting-linuxcnc,Getting LinuxCNC>>.

== Upgrade to the new version

To upgrade major versions like 2.6 to 2.7 when you have a network connection at
the machine you need to disable the old linuxcnc.org apt sources and add a new
linuxcnc.org apt source for 2.7, then upgrade LinuxCNC.

The details will depend on which platform you're running on. Open a
<<faq:terminal,terminal>> then type `lsb_release -ic` to find this information
out:

----
lsb_release -ic
Distributor ID: Debian
Codename:       wheezy
----

You should be running on Debian Wheezy (as above), or Ubuntu Precise,
or Ubuntu Lucid.


=== Setting apt sources

* Open the `Software Sources` window. The process for doing this
  differs slightly on the three supported platforms:

** Debian Wheezy:

*** Click on `Applications Menu`, then `System`, then
  `Synaptic Package Manager`.

*** In Synaptic, click on the `Settings` menu, then click `Repositories`
  to open the `Software Sources` window.

** Ubuntu Precise:

*** Click on the `Dash Home` icon in the top left.

*** In the `Search` field, type "software", then click on the `Ubuntu
  Software Center` icon.

*** In the Ubuntu Software Center window, click on the `Edit` menu,
  then click on `Software Sources...` to open the `Software Sources`
  window.

** Ubuntu Lucid:

*** Click the `System` menu, then `Administration`, then
  `Synaptic Package Manager`.

*** In Synaptic, click on the `Settings` menu, then click `Repositories`
  to open the `Software Sources` window.

* In the `Software Sources` window, select the `Other Software` tab.

* Delete or un-check all the old linuxcnc.org entries (leave all
  non-linuxcnc.org lines as they are).

* Click the `Add` button and add a new apt line. The line will be
  slightly different on the different platforms:

[options="header"]
|====
| Platform       | apt source line
| Debian Wheezy  | `deb http://linuxcnc.org wheezy base 2.7-rtai`
| Ubuntu Precise | `deb http://linuxcnc.org precise base 2.7-rtai`
| Ubuntu Lucid   | `deb http://linuxcnc.org lucid base 2.7-rtai`
|====

* Click `Add Source`, then `Close` in the Software Sources window.
  If it pops up a window informing you that the information about
  available software is out-of-date, click the `Reload` button.

=== Upgrading to the new version

Now your computer knows where to get the new version of the software,
next we need to install it.

The process again differs depending on your platform.

==== Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu Lucid

Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu Lucid both use the Synaptic Package Manager.

* Open Synaptic using the instructions in <<_setting_apt_sources,Setting
  apt sources>> above.

* Click the `Reload` button.

* Use the Search function to search for `linuxcnc`.

* Click the check box to mark the new linuxcnc and linuxcnc-doc-*
  packages for upgrade. The package manager may select a number of
  additional packages to be installed, to satisfy dependencies that the
  new linuxcnc package has.

* Click the `Apply` button, and let your computer install the new
  package. The old linuxcnc package will be automatically upgraded to
  the new one.

=== Ubuntu Precise

* Click on the `Dash Home` icon in the top left.

* In the `Search` field, type "update", then click on the `Update Manager`
  icon.

* Click the `Check` button to fetch the list of packages available.

* Click the `Install Updates` button to install the new versions of
  all packages.

== Updating without Network

To update without a network connection you need to download the deb then install
it with dpkg. The buildbot builds new debs each time something is updated and
stores them at http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/dists/

You have to drill down from the above link to find the correct deb for your
installation. Open a <<faq:terminal,terminal>> and type in 'lsb_release -ic'
to find the name of your OS. 

----
> lsb_release -ic
Distributor ID: Debian
Codename:       wheezy
----

Pick the OS from the list then pick the major version you want like 2.7-rt for
real time or 2.7-sim for the simulator only.

Next pick the type of computer you have i386 for 32 bit and amd64 for 64 bit.

Next pick the version you want from the bottom of the list like
'linuxcnc_2.7.4.46.g5954dcf_i386.deb'. Download the deb and copy it to your
home directory. You can rename the file to something a bit shorter with the file
manager like 'linuxcnc_2.7.4.deb' then open a terminal and install it with the
package manager with this command 'sudo dpkg -i linuxcnc_2.7.4.deb'

----
sudo dpkg -i linuxcnc_2.7.4.deb
----

== Updating Configuration Files

LinuxCNC version 2.7 differs from version 2.6 in some ways that may
require changes to your machine configuration.

=== Mesa Hardware

==== Hostmot2 Watchdog

If you have Mesa hardware the Hostmot2 watchdog now gets handled by the
hm2 `write` Hal function. Remove any `addf` lines that refer to the
`pet_watchdog` function from your main hal file.

==== Hostmot2 dpll

The Hostmot2 dpll's default time constant has been changed from 40960 to 2000.
The original value could occasionally lead to following errors when software
like ntpd and ntpdate adjusted the rate of the linux CLOCK_MONOTONIC time
source by up to 1000ppm in a single step. The new value allows the dpll to
adjust to the change in the base period frequency without error.

=== Parallel Port

If you use the Parallel Port driver there are some changes. Older versions
of the LinuxCNC `hal_parport` driver conflicted with the Linux `parport_pc`
driver. This required two mitigation techniques, prevent `parport_pc` from
loading, and load another LinuxCNC driver called `probe_parport` before loading
`hal_parport`.

The LinuxCNC `hal_parport` driver now cooperates well with the Linux
`parport_pc` driver, and these mitigation techniques are no longer
needed or useful. In 2.7, the `probe_parport` driver has been removed
from LinuxCNC.

This means configs that use the parallel port may need to be updated in
the following ways:

* Make sure LinuxCNC does not prevent the Linux `parport_pc` driver from
  loading. Older versions of LinuxCNC would blacklist `parport_pc` in
  `/etc/modprobe.d/linuxcnc.conf` (or `/etc/modprobe.d/emc2.conf` for even
  older versions of LinuxCNC). Comment out any lines in either of those files
  that looks like this:
  +
  `install parport_pc /bin/true`

* Make sure your Hal configuration does not have `loadrt probe_parport` in any
  .hal file.

=== Huanyang VFD

A driver for the Huanyang family of VFDs was added to LinuxCNC 2.7.
Before 2.7, the Huanyang VFD driver was maintained separately from
LinuxCNC.

If you use a Huanyang VFD and are switching to the LinuxCNC version of
the driver, you'll need to make a few changes to your HAL config.

|====
| old hy-vfd driver        | 2.7 hy-vfd driver
| hy_vfd.fwd               | hy_vfd.forward
| hy_vfd.rev               | hy_vfd.reverse
| hy_vfd.modbus-ok         | hy_vfd.hycomm-ok
| hy_vfd.motor-pole-number | (removed)
| hy_vfd.base-freq         | (removed)
