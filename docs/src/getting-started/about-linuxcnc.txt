= About LinuxCNC

== The Software

* LinuxCNC (the Enhanced Machine Control) is a software system for computer
  control of machine tools such as milling machines and lathes, robots
  such as puma and scara and other computer controlled machines up to 9 axes.
* LinuxCNC is free software with open source code. Current versions of LinuxCNC
  are entirely licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser
  GNU General Public License (GPL and LGPL)
* LinuxCNC provides:
** a graphical user interface (actually several interfaces to choose from)
** an interpreter for 'G-code' (the RS-274 machine tool programming language)
** a realtime motion planning system with look-ahead
** operation of low-level machine electronics such as sensors and motor drives
** an easy to use 'breadboard' layer for quickly creating a unique 
   configuration for your machine
** a software PLC programmable with ladder diagrams
** easy installation with a Live-CD
* It does not provide drawing (CAD - Computer Aided Design) or G-code
  generation from the drawing (CAM - Computer Automated Manufacturing)
  functions.
* It can simultaneously move up to 9 axes and supports a variety of
  interfaces.
* The control can operate true servos (analog or PWM) with the feedback
  loop closed by the LinuxCNC software at the computer, or open loop with
  step-servos or stepper motors.
* Motion control features include: cutter radius and length
  compensation, path deviation limited to a specified tolerance, lathe
  threading, synchronized axis motion, adaptive feedrate, operator feed
  override, and constant velocity control.
* Support for non-Cartesian motion systems is provided via custom
  kinematics modules. Available architectures include hexapods (Stewart
  platforms and similar concepts) and systems with rotary joints to
  provide motion such as PUMA or SCARA robots.
* LinuxCNC runs on Linux using real time extensions. 

== The Operating System

LinuxCNC is available as ready-to-use packages for the Ubuntu and Debian
distributions.


== Getting Help

=== IRC

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. 
It is a live connection to other LinuxCNC users. 
The LinuxCNC IRC channel is #linuxcnc on freenode.

The simplest way to get on the IRC is to use 
the embedded java client on this 
https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23linuxcnc[page].

.Some IRC etiquette

* Ask specific questions... Avoid questions like "Can someone help me?". 
* If you're really new to all this, think a bit about your question 
  before typing it. Make sure you give enough information so 
  someone can solve your question. 
* Have some patience when waiting for an answer, sometimes it takes a 
  while to formulate an answer or everyone might be busy working or 
  something. 
* Set up your IRC account with your unique name so people will know who 
  you are. If you use the java client, use the same name every time you 
  log in. This helps people remember who you are and if you have been on 
  before many will remember the past discussions which 
  saves time on both ends.

.Sharing Files

The most common way to share files on the IRC is to upload the file 
to one of the following or a similar service and paste the link:

* 'For text' - http://pastebin.com/ , http://pastie.org/, https://gist.github.com/
* 'For pictures' - http://imagebin.org/ , http://imgur.com/ , http://bayimg.com/
* 'For files' - https://filedropper.com/ , http://filefactory.com/ , http://1fichier.com/

=== Mailing List

An Internet Mailing List is a way to put questions out for everyone on
that list to see and answer at their convenience. You get better
exposure to your questions on a mailing list than on the IRC but
answers take longer. In a nutshell you e-mail a message to the list and
either get daily digests or individual replies back depending on how
you set up your account.

You can subscribe to the emc-users mailing list at:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emc-users

=== Web Forum

A web forum can be found at https://forum.linuxcnc.org or by following the link at the
top of the linuxcnc.org home page. 
This is quite active but the demographic is more user-biased than the mailing list. if
you want to be sure that your message is seen by the Develpers then the mailing list is
to be preferred. 

=== LinuxCNC Wiki

A Wiki site is a user maintained web site 
that anyone can add to or edit.

The user maintained LinuxCNC Wiki site contains a 
wealth of information and tips at:
