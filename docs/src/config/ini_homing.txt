==  [[sec:Homing]]Homing

=== Overview

Homing seems simple enough - just move each joint to a known location,
and set EMC's internal variables accordingly. However, different
machines have different requirements, and homing is actually quite
complicated.

=== Homing Sequence

There are four possible homing sequences, along with the associated
configuration parameters as shown in the following table. For a more
detailed description of what each configuration parameter does, see the
following section.

|========================================
|SEARCH_VEL | LATCH_VEL | USE_INDEX | Homing Type
|nonzero | nonzero | NO | Switch-only
|nonzero | nonzero | YES | Switch + Index

|Other combinations |  |  | Error
|========================================

=== Configuration

There are six pieces of information that determine exactly how the
home sequence behaves. They are defined in an [AXIS] section of the
inifile.

==== HOME_SEARCH_VEL (((HOME SEARCH VEL)))

The default value is zero. A value of zero causes EMC to assume that
there is no home switch; the search stage of homing is skipped.

If HOME_SEARCH_VEL is non-zero, then EMC assumes that there is a home
switch. It begins by checking whether the home switch is already
tripped. If tripped it backs off the switch at HOME_SEARCH_VEL. The
direction of the back-off is opposite the sign of HOME_SEARCH_VEL. Then
it searches for the home switch by moving in the direction specified by
the sign of HOME_SEARCH_VEL, at a speed determined by its absolute
value. When the home switch is detected, the joint will stop as fast as
possible, but there will always be some overshoot. The amount of
overshoot depends on the speed. If it is too high, the joint might
overshoot enough to hit a limit switch or crash into the end of travel.
On the other hand, if HOME_SEARCH_VEL is too low, homing can take a
long time.

==== HOME_LATCH_VEL (((HOME LATCH VEL)))

Specifies the speed and direction that EMC uses when it makes its
final accurate determination of the home switch (if present) and index
pulse location (if present). It will usually be slower than the search
velocity to maximise accuracy. If HOME_SEARCH_VEL and HOME_LATCH_VEL
have the same sign, then the latch phase is done while moving in the
same direction as the search phase. (In that case, EMC first backs off
the switch, before moving towards it again at the latch velocity.) If
HOME_SEARCH_VEL and HOME_LATCH_VEL have opposite signs, the latch phase
is done while moving in the opposite direction from the search phase.
That means EMC will latch the first pulse after it moves off the
switch. If HOME_SEARCH_VEL is zero (meaning there is no home switch),
and this parameter is nonzero, EMC goes ahead to the index pulse
search. If HOME_SEARCH_VEL is non-zero and this parameter is zero, it
is an error and the homing operation will fail. The default value is
zero.

==== HOME_FINAL_VEL

It specifies the speed that EMC uses when it makes its move from
HOME_OFFSET to the HOME position. If the HOME_FINAL_VEL is missing from
the ini file, then the maximum joint speed is used to make this move.
The value must a positive number.

==== HOME_IGNORE_LIMITS (((HOME IGNORE LIMITS)))

Can hold the values YES / NO. This flag determines whether EMC will
ignore the limit switch inputs. Some machine configurations do not use
a separate home switch, instead they route one of the limit switch
signals to the home switch input as well. In this case, EMC needs to
ignore that limit during homing. The default value for this parameter
is NO.

==== HOME_USE_INDEX (((HOME USE INDEX)))

Specifies whether or not there is an index pulse. If the flag is true
(HOME_USE_INDEX = YES), EMC will latch on the rising edge of the index
pulse. If false, EMC will latch on either the rising or falling edge of
the home switch (depending on the signs of HOME_SEARCH_VEL and
HOME_LATCH_VEL). The default value is NO.

==== HOME_OFFSET (((HOME OFFSET)))

Contains the location of the home switch or index pulse, in joint
coordinates. It can also be treated as the distance between the point
where the switch or index pulse is latched and the zero point of the
joint. After detecting the index pulse, EMC sets the joint coordinate
of the current point to HOME_OFFSET. The default value is zero.

==== HOME (((HOME)))

The position that the joint will go to upon completion of the homing
sequence. After detecting the index pulse, and setting the coordinate
of that point to HOME_OFFSET, EMC makes a move to HOME as the final
step of the homing process. The default value is zero. Note that even
if this parameter is the same as HOME_OFFSET, the axis will slightly
overshoot the latched position as it stops. Therefore there will always
be a small move at this time (unless HOME_SEARCH_VEL is zero, and the
entire search/latch stage was skipped). This final move will be made at
the joint's maximum velocity. Since the axis is now homed, there should
be no risk of crashing the machine, and a rapid move is the quickest
way to finish the homing sequence. footnote:[The distinction between
'home' and 'home_offset' is not as clear as I
would like. I intend to make a small drawing and example to help
clarify it.

==== HOME_IS_SHARED (((HOME IS SHARED)))

If there is not a separate home switch input for this axis, but a
number of momentary switches wired to the same pin, set this value to 1
to prevent homing from starting if one of the shared switches is
already closed. Set this value to 0 to permit homing even if the switch
is already closed.

==== HOME_SEQUENCE (((HOME SEQUENCE)))

Used to define a multi-axis homing sequence HOME ALL and enforce
homing order (e.g., Z may not be homed if X is not yet homed). An axis
may be homed after all axes with a lower HOME_SEQUENCE have already
been homed and are at the HOME_OFFSET. If two axes have the same
HOME_SEQUENCE, they may be homed at the same time. If HOME_SEQUENCE is
-1 or not specified then this joint will not be homed by the HOME ALL
sequence. HOME_SEQUENCE numbers start with 0 and there may be no unused
numbers.
