= Basic Configuration

== Introduction[[sec:Introduction]]

The preferred way to set up a standard stepper machine is with the
Step Configuration Wizard. See the Getting Started Guide.

This chapter describes some of the more common settings for manually
setting up a stepper based system. Because of the various possibilities
of configuring EMC2, it is very hard to document them all, and keep
this document relatively short.

The most common EMC2 usage is for stepper based systems. These systems
are using stepper motors with drives that accept step & direction
signals.

It is one of the simpler setups, because the motors run open-loop (no
feedback comes back from the motors), yet the system needs to be
configured properly so the motors don't stall or lose steps.

Most of this chapter is based on the sample config released along with
EMC2. The config is called stepper(((stepper))), and usually it is
found in `/etc/emc2/sample-configs/stepper`.

== Maximum step rate[[sec:Maximum-step-rate]](((step rate)))

With software step generation, the maximum step rate is one step per
two BASE_PERIODs for step-and-direction output. The maximum requested
step rate is the product of an axis' MAX_VELOCITY and its INPUT_SCALE.
If the requested step rate is not attainable, following errors will
occur, particularly during fast jogs and G0 moves.

If your stepper driver can accept quadrature input, use this mode.
With a quadrature signal, one step is possible for each BASE_PERIOD,
doubling the maximum step rate.

The other remedies are to decrease one or more of: the BASE_PERIOD
(setting this too low will cause the machine to become unresponsive or
even lock up), the INPUT_SCALE (if you can select different step sizes
on your stepper driver, change pulley ratios, or leadscrew pitch), or
the MAX_VELOCITY and STEPGEN_MAXVEL.

If no valid combination of BASE_PERIOD, INPUT_SCALE, and MAX_VELOCITY
is acceptable, then consider using hardware step generation (such as
with the emc2-supported Universal Stepper Controller, Mesa cards, and
others.)

== Pinout[[sec:Pinout]](((pinout)))

One of the major flaws in EMC was that you couldn't specify the pinout
without recompiling the source code. EMC2 is far more flexible, and now
(thanks to the Hardware Abstraction Layer) you can easily specify which
signal goes where. See the HAL manual for more detailed information on
HAL.

As it is described in the HAL Introduction and tutorial, we have
signals, pins and parameters inside the HAL.

The ones relevant for our pinout are: footnote:[Note: we are only
presenting one axis to keep it short, all others are similar.]

    signals: Xstep, Xdir & Xen
    pins: parport.0.pin-XX-out & parport.0.pin-XX-in

Depending on what you have chosen in your .ini file you are using
either standard_pinout.hal or xylotex_pinout.hal. These are two files
that instruct the HAL how to link the various signals & pins. Further
on we'll investigate the standard_pinout.hal.

=== standard_pinout.hal[[sub:standard_pinout.hal]](((standard pinout))) 

This file contains several HAL commands, and usually looks like this:

----------------------------------------
# standard pinout config file for 3-axis steppers
# using a parport for I/O
#
# first load the parport driver
loadrt hal_parport cfg="0x0378"
#
# next connect the parport functions to threads
# read inputs first
addf parport.0.read base-thread 1
# write outputs last
addf parport.0.write base-thread -1
#
# finally connect physical pins to the signals
net Xstep => parport.0.pin-03-out
net Xdir  => parport.0.pin-02-out
net Ystep => parport.0.pin-05-out
net Ydir  => parport.0.pin-04-out
net Zstep => parport.0.pin-07-out
net Zdir  => parport.0.pin-06-out

# create a signal for the estop loopback
net estop-loop iocontrol.0.user-enable-out iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in

# create signals for tool loading loopback
net tool-prep-loop iocontrol.0.tool-prepare iocontrol.0.tool-prepared
net tool-change-loop iocontrol.0.tool-change iocontrol.0.tool-changed

# connect "spindle on" motion controller pin to a physical pin
net spindle-on motion.spindle-on => parport.0.pin-09-out

###
### You might use something like this to enable chopper drives when machine ON
### the Xen signal is defined in core_stepper.hal
###

# net Xen => parport.0.pin-01-out

###
### If you want active low for this pin, invert it like this:
###

# setp parport.0.pin-01-out-invert 1

###
### A sample home switch on the X axis (axis 0).  make a signal,
### link the incoming parport pin to the signal, then link the signal
### to EMC's axis 0 home switch input pin
###

# net Xhome parport.0.pin-10-in => axis.0.home-sw-in

###
### Shared home switches all on one parallel port pin?
### that's ok, hook the same signal to all the axes, but be sure to 
### set HOME_IS_SHARED and HOME_SEQUENCE in the ini file.  See the
### user manual!
###

# net homeswitches <= parport.0.pin-10-in
# net homeswitches => axis.0.home-sw-in
# net homeswitches => axis.1.home-sw-in
# net homeswitches => axis.2.home-sw-in

###
### Sample separate limit switches on the X axis (axis 0)
###

# net X-neg-limit parport.0.pin-11-in => axis.0.neg-lim-sw-in
# net X-pos-limit parport.0.pin-12-in => axis.0.pos-lim-sw-in

###
### Just like the shared home switches example, you can wire together
### limit switches.  Beware if you hit one, EMC will stop but can't tell
### you which switch/axis has faulted.  Use caution when recovering from this.
###

# net Xlimits parport.0.pin-13-in => axis.0.neg-lim-sw-in axis.0.pos-lim-sw-in

The lines starting with '#' are comments, and their only purpose is to
guide the reader through the file.

=== Overview of the standard_pinout.hal[[sub:Overview-standard_pinout.hal]]

There are a couple of operations that get executed when the
standard_pinout.hal gets executed / interpreted:

 . The Parport driver gets loaded (see the Parport section of 
   the HAL Manual for details)
 . The read & write functions of the parport driver get assigned to the
   base thread footnote:[the fastest thread in the EMC2 setup, usually the
   code gets executed every few tens of microseconds]
 . The step & direction signals for axes X,Y,Z get linked to pins on the
   parport
 . Further I/O signals get connected (estop loopback, toolchanger loopback)
 . A spindle-on signal gets defined and linked to a parport pin

=== Changing the standard_pinout.hal[[sub:Changing-standard_pinout.hal]]

If you want to change the standard_pinout.hal file, all you need is a
text editor. Open the file and locate the parts you want to change.

If you want for example to change the pin for the X-axis Step &
Directions signals, all you need to do is to change the number in the
'parport.0.pin-XX-out' name:

    net Xstep parport.0.pin-03-out 
    net Xdir  parport.0.pin-02-out

can be changed to:

    net Xstep parport.0.pin-02-out 
    net Xdir  parport.0.pin-03-out

or basically any other numbers you like.

Hint: make sure you don't have more than one signal connected to the
same pin.

=== Changing the polarity of a signal[[sub:Changing-the-polarity]](((signal polarity)))

If external hardware expects an “active low” signal, set the
corresponding `-invert` parameter. For instance, to invert the spindle
control signal:

    setp parport.0.pin-09-invert TRUE

=== Adding PWM Spindle Speed Control[[sub:PWM-Spindle-Speed]](((spindle speed control)))

If your spindle can be controlled by a PWM signal, use the `pwmgen`
component to create the signal:

    loadrt pwmgen output_type=0
    addf pwmgen.update servo-thread
    addf pwmgen.make-pulses base-thread
    net spindle-speed-cmd motion.spindle-speed-out => pwmgen.0.value
    net spindle-on motion.spindle-on => pwmgen.0.enable
    net spindle-pwm pwmgen.0.pwm => parport.0.pin-09-out
    setp pwmgen.0.scale 1800 # Change to your spindle’s top speed in RPM

This assumes that the spindle controller's response to PWM is simple:
0% PWM gives 0 RPM, 10% PWM gives 180 RPM, etc. If there is a minimum
PWM required to get the spindle to turn, follow the example in the
'nist-lathe' sample configuration to use a `scale` component.

=== Adding an enable signal[[sub:Adding-enable-signal]](((enable signal)))

Some amplifiers (drives) require an enable signal before they accept
and command movement of the motors. For this reason there are already
defined signals called 'Xen', 'Yen', 'Zen'.

To connect them use the following example:

    net Xen parport.0.pin-08-out

You can either have one single pin that enables all drives; or
several, depending on the setup you have. Note, however, that usually
when one axis faults, all the other drives will be disabled as well, so
having only one enable signal / pin for all drives is a common
practice.

=== Adding an external ESTOP button(((ESTOP)))

As you can see in  <<sub:standard_pinout.hal>> by default the stepper
configuration assumes no external ESTOP button. footnote:[An extensive
explanation of hooking up ESTOP circuitry is explained in
the wiki.linuxcnc.org and elsewhere in the Integrator Manual]

To add a simple external button you need to replace the line:

    net estop-loop iocontrol.0.user-enable-out iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in

with

    net estop-loop parport.0.pin-01-in iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in

This assumes an ESTOP switch connected to pin 01 on the parport. As
long as the switch will stay pushedfootnote:[make sure you use a
maintained switch for ESTOP.], EMC2 will be in the ESTOP state. 
When the external button gets 
released EMC2 will immediately switch to the ESTOP-RESET state, and all
you need to do is switch to Machine On(((machine on))) and you'll be
able to continue your work with EMC2.
