= Writing automated LinuxCNC tests

== The test framework

The code base has unit and integration tests that can be executed automatically to ensure the program works as intended.
Such tests are often written to trigger a bug and to ensure the bug is detected if it resurfaces in the future, but also to validate behavior of components and interfaces.

The tests are collected in the `tests/` directory.
The individual tests are in subdirectories of this directory.
The tests are grouped in directories.

== Running tests

The tests are executed by the `scripts/runtests` script generated from `scripts/runtests.in` during build.
The runtests script will by default locate tests to run under `tests/`, but can be limited to only run a limited set of tests by specifying the directory of the test or tests as argument(s).

.An example running only the tests in `tests/lathe/`.
----
$ scripts/runtests tests/lathe/
Running test: tests/lathe
Runtest: 1 tests run, 1 successful, 0 failed + 0 expected, 0 skipped
----

The runtests script looks for all files named `test`, `test.sh` or `test.hal` below the directories specified on the command line, or under `tests/` if no command line argument is specified.
These files represent three different ways to run the tests.

The _runtests_ script accepts the following arguments, see the output from `scripts/runtests -h` for the authoritative list:
----
-n  do not remove temporary files for successful tests.
-s  stop after any failed test.
-p  print stderr and result files.
-c  Remove temporary files from an earlier test run.
-u  Only run tests that require normal user access.
-v  Show stdout and stderr (normally it's hidden).
----

== Writing tests

Make sure the test can run successfully without a working X11 display, i.e. with the DISPLAY environment variable unset.

1. Create a folder in `tests/`.
2. Provide one test script.
3. Evaluate the output with one of the options below.

These are the files considered in the directory with the individual tests:

.Test script (only one of these three)

test::
   A program that is executed and its exit code and output checked using either checkresult or expected.

test.sh::
   A bash script that is executed and its exit code and output checked using either checkresult or expected.

test.hal::
   A HAL script that is executed using `halrun -f test.hal` and its exit code and output checked using either checkresult or expected.

.Test evaluation

 expected::
   A file whose content is compared to the output from running the test scripts.
   If the test output is identical to the content of the expected file, the test succeeds.

checkresult::
   An executable file to perform more complex validation than just comparing the output of a test script.
   It gets the filename of the test program as its command line argument.
   The exit code of this program controls the result of the test.
   If both `expected` and `checkresult` exist, only `checkresult` is consulted to validate the test output.

 xfail::
   If this file exist, a test failure is expected and does not cause runtests to return an exit code signaling an error.

 skip::
   If this file exist, the test is skipped and not executed at all.

 control::
   This file can be used to flag specific needs in the test.
   At the moment, the use of _sudo_ can be flagged, and tests requiring sudo can be skipped when using `runtests -u`.
   To flag such requirements, add a line with `Restrictions: sudo` to this file.

== Some testing approaches

There are various ways to structure a test, depending on what one wants to test.
Here are a few ideas on how to do it.

=== Non-interactive "GUI"

If you want to test some operations in the user interface, a useful approach is is to write a custom "GUI" simulating the operations.
This can be done by creating a normal LinuxCNC setup and pointing the [DISPLAY] DISPLAY value to a script that does the operations needed to test the behaviour.

Examples of this approach can be found in `tests/halui/jogging/` and `tests/interp/subroutine-return/`.

=== Recording HAL pin transitions

Using the _sampler_ and _halsampler_ HAL components, one can set up a HAL configuration and collect pin value settings and changes and dump the result to stdout (or a file).
The end result can then be compared with the expected output to verify if HAL behaves as expected.

Examples of this approach can be found in `tests/multiclick/` and `tests/stepgen.2/`.
