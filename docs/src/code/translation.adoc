= Translations

All program code and documentation is written in US English.

All translations are performed with the help of the
link:https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/linuxcnc/[weblate] services.
The source tree then maintains the .po files in sync with that online
representation.

Our users and developers are kindly asked to help with the translation.
