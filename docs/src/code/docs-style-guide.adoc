// Preamble End

[[docs:style:ssot]]
== Single Source Of Truth (SSOT)

The {ldocs} is the SSOT for all information related to LinuxCNC implementation,
usage, and troubleshooting.

It evolves continuously, in keeping with new features, and with improvements
for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

This policy prevents information silos, making it easier to find information
about LinuxCNC applications.

It also informs decisions about the kinds of content we include in our
documentation.

=== Include all information

Include problem-solving actions that may address rare cases or be considered
risky, but provide proper context through fully detailed warnings and
caveats.

This kind of content should be included as it could be helpful to others
and, when properly explained, its benefits outweigh the risks. If you
think you have found an exception to this rule, contact the
Technical Writing team.

LinuxCNC adds all troubleshooting information to the documentation, no
matter how unlikely a user is to encounter a situation.

////
FIXME Add Troubleshooting documentation
LinuxCNC Support maintains their own
link:../../../administration/index.md#support-team-documentation[troubleshooting content]
in the LinuxCNC documentation.
////

[[docs:style:media]]
=== Include all media types

Include any media types/sources if the content is relevant to readers.

You can freely include or link presentations, diagrams, and videos. No
matter who it was originally composed for, if it is helpful to any of
our audiences, we can include it.

* If you use an image that has a separate source file (for example, a
  vector or diagram format), link the image to the source file so that
  anyone can update or reuse it.
* Do not copy and paste content from other sources unless it is a limited
  quotation with the source cited. Typically it is better to either rephrase
  relevant information in your own words or link out to the other source.

////
=== Documentation structure

TODO Revise documentation structure
  @silopolis: Structure documentation in parts targeted at user personas:
    * Administrator
    * Integrator
    * User
    * Contributor

FIXME Sync Web and PDF documentation structure
////

////
TODO Define LinuxCNC topic types
=== Topic types

In the software industry, it is a best practice to organize documentation
in different types:

* Concepts / Explanations (Understanding-oriented)
* Tasks / Tutorials (Learning-oriented)
* Reference (Information-oriented)
* Troubleshooting / How-to guides (Problem-oriented)

See:

* https://documentation.divio.com/
* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc/development/documentation/topic_types

Ideally, every significant matter should be present in the target part(s)
of the documentation and should offer content in each relevant topic.

LinuxCNC has not traditionally used topic types. However, we are starting
to move in this direction, so we can address these issues:

* *Content is hard to find.* +
  Our docs are comprehensive and include a large amount of useful information.
  Topic types create repeatable patterns that make our content easier to
  scan and parse.
* *Content is often written from the contributor's point of view.* +
  Our docs are written by contributors. Topic types (tasks specifically)
  help put information into a format that is geared toward helping others,
  rather than documenting how a feature was implemented.

LinuxCNC uses these xref:../structure.adoc[topic types].
////

=== Link instead of repeating text

Rather than repeating information from another topic, link to the single
source of truth and explain why it is important.

////
FIXME Could we adopt a documentation first methodology ?
=== Docs-first methodology

We employ a documentation-first methodology. This method ensures the
documentation remains a complete and trusted resource, and makes
communicating about the use of LinuxCNC more efficient.

* If the answer to a question exists in documentation, share the link to
  the documentation instead of rephrasing the information.
* When you encounter new information not available in LinuxCNC documentation
  (for example, when solving an issue, helping another user, or testing
  a feature), your first step should be to 
  https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/issues[create a pull request (PR)]
  to add this information to the documentation. You can then share the PR
  to communicate this information.

New information that would be useful toward the future usage or troubleshooting
of LinuxCNC should not be written directly in a forum or other messaging
system, but added to a documentation PR and then referenced, as described
above.

The more we reflexively add information to the documentation, the more
the documentation helps others efficiently accomplish tasks and solve problems.

If you have questions when considering, authoring, or editing documentation,
ask the Technical Writing team. They're available in `#linuxcnc-docs` rooms
on messaging platforms or in
https://forum.linuxcnc.org/32-documents[LinuxCNC forum Documents category].
// FIXME Do we need/want assignments ?
//by mentioning https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#assignments[the writer for]
// FIXME Do we need/want a more formal workflow ?
//the applicable https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages[DevOps stage or group].
Otherwise, forge ahead with your best effort. It does not need to be perfect;
the team is happy to review and improve upon your content. Review the
// TODO Development development front page
xref:index.adoc[Documentation guidelines] before you begin your first
documentation PR.

Maintaining a knowledge base separate from the documentation would be against
the documentation-first methodology, because the content would overlap with
the documentation.
////

[[docs:style:asciidoc]]
== AsciiDoc

All LinuxCNC documentation is written using
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[AsciiDoc].

=== HTML in AsciiDoc

Hard-coded HTML is valid, although it's discouraged from being used. +
HTML is permitted if:

* There's no equivalent markup in AsciiDoc.
* Advanced tables are necessary.
* Special styling is required.
* Reviewed and approved by a technical writer.

=== Headings in AsciiDoc

Each documentation page begins with a level 1 heading (`=`). +
This becomes the `h1` element when the page is rendered to HTML. +
There can be only *one* level 1 heading per page.

* For each subsection, increment the heading level.
  In other words, increment the number of `=` characters in front of the
  heading.
* Avoid headings greater than `H5` (`=====`). If you need more than five
  heading levels, move the topics to a new page instead. +
//  Headings greater than `H5` do not display in the right sidebar navigation.
* Do not skip a level. For example: `==` > `====`.
* Leave one blank line before and after the heading.

// FIXME Title anchoring
When you change heading text, the anchor link changes. +
To avoid broken links:

* Do not use step numbers in headings.
* When possible, do not use words that might change in the future.

Also, do not use links as part of heading text.

// TODO See also xref:../structure.adoc[heading guidelines for specific topic types].

=== Backticks in AsciiDoc

Use backticks for things that are either typed into the system or read in
the system:

* Commands, options, parameters names.
* Packages, modules, classes, functions, arguments names.
* <<code-blocks,Code blocks>>.
* Error messages.

////
TODO Documentation testing and AsciiDoc linting
IDEA Use po4a as linter ? Pre-commit hook ?

=== AsciiDoc Rules

LinuxCNC ensures that the AsciiDoc used across all documentation is consistent, as
well as easy to review and maintain, by xref:../testing.adoc[testing documentation changes]
with link:../testing.md#markdownlint[markdownlint]. This lint test fails when any
document has an issue with AsciiDoc formatting that may cause the page to render
incorrectly in LinuxCNC. It also fails when a document has
non-standard AsciiDoc (which may render correctly, but is not the current
standard for LinuxCNC documentation).

==== AsciiDoc rule `MD044/proper-names` (capitalization)

A rule that could cause confusion is `MD044/proper-names`, as it might not be
immediately clear what caused markdownlint to fail, or how to correct the
failure. This rule checks a list of known words, listed in the `.markdownlint.yml`
file in each project, to verify proper use of capitalization and backticks.
Words in backticks are ignored by markdownlint.

In general, product names should follow the exact capitalization of the official
names of the products, protocols, and so on.

Some examples fail if incorrect capitalization is used:

* MinIO (needs capital `IO`)
* NGINX (needs all capitals)
* runit (needs lowercase `r`)

Additionally, commands, parameters, values, filenames, and so on must be
included in backticks. For example:

* "Change the `needs` keyword in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`..."
 ** `needs` is a parameter, and `.gitlab-ci.yml` is a file, so both need backticks.
Additionally, `.gitlab-ci.yml` without backticks fails markdownlint because it
does not have capital G or L.
* "Run `git clone` to clone a Git repository..."
 ** `git clone` is a command, so it must be lowercase, while Git is the product,
so it must have a capital G.
////

[[docs:style:language]]
== Language

LinuxCNC documentation should be clear and easy to understand.

* Avoid unnecessary words.
* Be clear, concise, and stick to the goal of the topic.
* Write in US English with US grammar.

////
TODO grammar and spell checking
  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/British.yml[`British.yml`]
  https://vale.sh/
  https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action
  https://github.com/errata-ai/packages
////

=== Capitalization

As a project, we tend toward lowercase.

==== Headings

////
FIXME Choose titles capitalization style: sentence or headline
https://github.com/nofluffjuststuff/nfjsmag-docs/blob/master/author-writing-style-and-syntax-guide.adoc#headline
////

Use sentence case. For example:

* `= Use variables to configure pipelines`
* `== Use the To-Do List`

==== User interfaces text

When referring to specific user interface (UI) text, like a button label
or menu item, use the same capitalization that's displayed in the user
interface.

////
TODO Standards for this content are listed in the
https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation/[Pajamas Design System Content section]
and typically match what's mentioned in this Documentation Style Guide.
////

If you think the UI text contains style mistakes, create an issue or a PR
to propose a change to the user interface text.

==== Feature names

* Feature names are typically lowercase.
* Some features require title case, typically nouns that name LinuxCNC-specific
  capabilities or tools. +
  Features requiring title case should be added to the
  xref:word_list.adoc[word list].
////
FIXME No equivalent linter to markdownlint to use a config file like
  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.markdownlint.yml
  so that it can be consistently applied across all documentation.
////

If the term is not in the word list, ask a LinuxCNC Technical Writer for
advice.

==== Other terms

Capitalize names of:

* Third-party organizations, software, and products. For example, FreeCAD,
  MachineKit, Git, and The Linux Foundation.
* Methods or methodologies. For example, Continuous Integration,
  Continuous Deployment, Unit Testing, and Agile.

Follow the capitalization style listed at the authoritative source for the
entity, which may use non-standard case styles. For example: LinuxCNC and
npm.

[[docs:style:fake]]
=== Fake data

==== Fake user informations

Do not use real user informations or email addresses in LinuxCNC documentation.
For email addresses and names, use:

* Email addresses: Use an email address ending in `example.com`.
* Names: Use strings like `example_username`. Alternatively, use diverse
  or non-gendered names with common surnames, such as `Sidney Jones`,
  `Zhang Wei`, or `Alex Garcia`.

==== Fake URLs

When including sample URLs in the documentation, use `example.com` when
the domain name is generic.

=== Contractions

Contractions are encouraged to make writing simpler and easier to read.
They can create a friendly and informal tone, especially in tutorials,
instructional documentation, and user interfaces.

However, don’t make a sentence harder to understand just to follow this
rule.

|===
| Do | Don’t

| it’s, can’t, wouldn’t, you’re, you’ve, haven’t, don’t
| it is, cannot, would not, it’ll, should’ve
|===

Some contractions, however, should be avoided:

// vale gitlab.Possessive = NO

|===
| Do not use a contraction | Example | Use instead

| With a proper noun and a verb
| The *Container Registry's* a powerful feature.
| The *Container Registry* is a powerful feature.

| To emphasize a negative
| *Don't* install X with Y.
| *Do not* install X with Y.

| In reference documentation
| *Don't* set a limit.
| *Do not* set a limit.

| In error messages
| Requests to localhost *aren't* allowed.
| Requests to localhost *are not* allowed.
|===

// vale gitlab.Possessive = YES

=== Acronyms

If you use an acronym, spell it out on first use on a page. +
You do not need to spell it out more than once on a page.

When possible, try to avoid acronyms in headings.

=== Numbers

When using numbers in text:

* spell out zero through nine
* use numbers for 10 and greater

For details, see the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/numbers[Microsoft Style Guide].

== Text

* Write in <<docs:style:asciidoc,AsciiDoc>>.
// FIXME Decide on fixed line width.
//   @silopolis: 100 seems to correspond more or less to the number of
//               characters in a line on a printed page
* Splitting long lines (preferably up to 100 characters) can make it easier
  to provide feedback on small chunks of text.
* Insert an empty line for new paragraphs.
* Insert an empty line between different markups (for example, after every
  paragraph, header, list, and so on). Example:
+
```markdown
== Header

Paragraph.

* List item 1
* List item 2
```

* Use forced line breaks `+` to structure paragraphs and create clarity.

=== Comments

// FIXME Comments

To embed comments within AsciiDoc, use standard HTML comments that are not
rendered when published. +
Example:

`+html
<!-- This is a comment that is not rendered -->
+`

=== Emphasis

Use _italic_ to provide _emphasis_ or when you are introducing a term for
the first time. +
Use *bold* to provide *strong emphasis*.

////
FIXME Could we switch to sans-serif fonts, please ?!
LinuxCNC uses a sans-serif font and italic text does not stand out as much
as it would in a serif font. +
For details, see https://practicaltypography.com/bold-or-italic.html[Butterick's Practical Typography guide on bold or italic].
////

* Use asterisks (`\*`) to mark a word or text in bold (`*bold*`).
* Use underscore (`\_`) for text in italics (`_italic_`).
* Use backticks (```) for blockquotes.

=== Punctuation

Follow these guidelines for punctuation:

// vale gitlab.Repetition = NO

* End full sentences with a period.
* Use one space between sentences.
* Do not use semicolons. Use two sentences instead.
* Do not use double spaces.
// TODO Test with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/SentenceSpacing.yml[`SentenceSpacing.yml`].
* Do not use non-breaking spaces. Use standard spaces instead.
// TODO Test with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/scripts/lint-doc.sh[`lint-doc.sh`].
* Do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead. +
  You can configure your code editor to output spaces instead of tabs
  when pressing the tab key.
* Use serial (Oxford) commas before the final *and* or *or* in a list of
  three or more items.
// TODO Test with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/OxfordComma.yml[`OxfordComma.yml`].
* Avoid dashes. Use separate sentences, or commas, instead.
* Do not use typographer's ("curly") quotes. Use straight quotes instead.
// TODO Test with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/NonStandardQuotes.yml[`NonStandardQuotes.yml`].

// vale gitlab.Repetition = YES

=== Placeholder text

// TODO Extend with complete usage message syntax

You might want to provide a command or configuration that uses specific
values.

In these cases, use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_message#Pattern[`<` and `>`]
to call out where a reader must replace text with their own value.

For example:

[source,sh]
cp <your_source_directory> <your_destination_directory>

=== Keyboard commands

Use the keyboard macro with the `+kbd:[key(+key)*]+` syntax when referring
to keystroke presses.

Multiple keys are separated by a plus, and alpha keys should be represented
in uppercase.

For example:

[source]
To stop the command, press kbd:[Control+C].

When the docs are generated, the output is:

====
To stop the command, press kbd:[Control+C].
====

// TODO Add escaped characters https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/keyboard-macro/

=== Text entered in the UI

If you want the user to type something in the UI, use backticks. +
For example:

[source]
In the *Commit message* box, type `This is my merge request`.

Backticks are more precise than quotes and avoid painful escaping when input
text contains quotes.

=== Inline code

Inline code style is applied inline with regular text.

Use inline code style:

* For filenames or fragments of configuration files. +
  For example: `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `CODEOWNERS`, and `only: [main]`.
* For methods and STATUS messages
  For example: FIXME

To apply inline code style, wrap the text in a single backtick (```). +
For example: `this is inline code style`.

=== Code blocks

Code block style separates code text from regular text.

Use code block style for commands run in the command-line interface. +
Code block style is easier to copy and paste in a user's terminal window.

// FIXME Code blocks styling
//   https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/verbatim/source-blocks/
//   https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html#X104
To apply code block style, wrap the text in quadruple dashes (four `-`)
and add a `source` style with the adequate language.
For example:


----
This is codeblock style
----

When using code block style:

* Use quadruple backticks (four ```) to apply code block style when the
  code block you are styling has triple backticks in it. +
  For example, when illustrating code block style.
* Add a blank line above and below code blocks.
* Syntax highlight hints are required for code blocks. +
  See the https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers[list of supported languages and lexers]
  for available syntax highlighters. +
  Use `plaintext` if no better hint is available.

== Lists

* Always start list items with a capital letter, unless they're parameters
  or commands that are in backticks, or similar.
* Always leave a blank line before and after a list.
* Begin a line with spaces (not tabs) to denote a <<nesting-inside-a-list-item,nested sub-item>>.

// TODO Complex lists https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/continuation/

=== Choose between an ordered or unordered list

Use ordered lists for a sequence of steps, ie:

[source,adoc]
----
Follow these steps to do something.

. First, do the first step.
. Then, do the next step.
. Finally, do the last step.
----

Use an unordered lists when the steps do not need to be completed in order,
ie:

[source,adoc]
----
These things are imported:

* Thing 1
* Thing 2
* Thing 3
----

=== Markup

* Use asterisk (`*`) for unordered lists.
* Use dots/periods (`.`) for ordered lists.

// TODO Forcing lists appart
//   https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/unordered/
//   https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/separating/

=== Punctuation

* Don't add commas (`,`) or semicolons (`;`) to the ends of list items.
* If a list item is a complete sentence (with a subject and a verb), add
  a period at the end.
* Majority rules: if the majority of items do not end in a period, do not
  end any of the items in a period.
* Separate list items from explanatory text with a colon (`:`). +
  For example:
+
[source,adoc]
----
The list is as follows:

* First item: this explains the first item.
* Second item: this explains the second item.
----

=== Nesting inside a list item

// TODO Nesting lists https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/unordered/

It's possible to nest items under a list item, so that they render with
the same indentation as the list item. This can be done with:

// FIXME Anchors
* <<code-blocks,Code blocks>>
* <<blockquotes,Blockquotes>>
* <<alert-boxes,Alert boxes>>
* <<images,Images>>

Items nested in lists should always align with the first character of the
list item. In unordered lists (using `*`), this means two spaces for each
level of indentation:

[source,adoc]
----
- Unordered list item 1

  A line nested using 2 spaces to align with the `U` above.

* Unordered list item 2
+
____
A quote block that will nest
inside list item 2.
____

* Unordered list item 3
+
-----
a code block that nests inside list item 3
-----

* Unordered list item 4
+
image:image.png[an image that will nest inside list item 4]
----

For explicitly numbered ordered lists, use three spaces for each level of
indentation:

[source,adoc]
----
1. Ordered list item 1

A line nested using 3 spaces to align with the `O` above.

. Ordered list item 2
+
____
A quote block that will nest
inside list item 2.
____

. Ordered list item 3
+
-----
a code block that nests inside list item 3
-----

. Ordered list item 4
+
image:image.png[an image that will nest inside list item 4]
----

You can nest full lists inside other lists using the same rules as above.
If you want to mix types, that's also possible, if you don't mix items at
the same level:

[source,adoc]
----
1. Ordered list item one.
1. Ordered list item two.
   - Nested unordered list item one.
   - Nested unordered list item two.
1. Ordered list item three.

* Unordered list item one.
* Unordered list item two.
 .. Nested ordered list item one.
 .. Nested ordered list item two.
* Unordered list item three.
----

[[docs:style:tables]]
== Tables

Tables should be used to describe complex information in a straightforward
manner. Note that in many cases, an unordered list is sufficient to describe
a list of items with a single, simple description per item. But, if you
have data that's best described by a matrix, tables are the best choice.

// TODO Improve tables
//   https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/
//   https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html#_tables

=== Creation guidelines

To keep tables accessible and scannable, tables should not have any
empty cells. If there is no otherwise meaningful value for a cell, consider entering
*N/A* for 'not applicable' or *None*.

To help tables be easier to maintain, consider adding additional spaces to the
column widths to make them consistent. +
For example:

[source,adoc]
----
|===
| App name | Description          | Requirements

| App 1    | Description text 1.  | Requirements 1
| App 2    | Description text 2.  | None
|===
----

// TODO Editors plugins or extensions for formatting AsciiDoc tables ?

=== Table headings

Use sentence case for table headings. +
For example: `Keyword value` or `Project name`.

=== Feature tables

// FIXME Feature tables, or delete ?
When creating tables of lists of features use these phrases:

|===
| Option | AsciiDoc | Displayed result

| No
| `+**{dotted-circle}** No+`
| *\{dotted-circle}* No

| Yes
| `+**{check-circle}** Yes+`
| *\{check-circle}* Yes
|===


[[docs:style:footnotes]]
== Footnotes

For tables footnotes, use:

* A superscript number between square brackets at the end of cell content,
  separated by a space.
* An ordered list below the table for footnotes content

For example:

[source,adoc]
----
|===
| App name | Description                      |

| App A    | Description text. ^[1]^
| App B    | Description text. ^[2]^
|===

. This is the first footnote.
. This is the second footnote.
----

This text renders this output:

|===
| App name | Description

| App A | Description text. ^[1]^
| App B | Description text. ^[2]^
|===

. This is the first footnote.
. This is the second footnote.


[[docs:style:quotes]]
== Quotes

* Standard quotes: double quotes (`"`). +
  Example: "This is wrapped in double quotes".
* Quote inside a quote: double quotes (`"`) wrapped into single quotes (`'`). +
  Example: "This sentence 'quotes' something in a quote".

////
TODO Other punctuation rules, refer to the
  https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation/[Pajamas Design System Punctuation section].
  This is overridden by the <<punctuation,documentation-specific punctuation rules>>.
////


[[docs:style:links]]
== Links

//  https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html#_inline_macros

Links are important in LinuxCNC documentation. Use links instead of
summarizing to help preserve a <<docs:style:ssot,single source of truth>>.

We include guidance for links in these categories:

* How to set up <<docs:style:anchors,anchor links>> for headings.
* How to set up <<basic-link-criteria,criteria>> for configuring a link.
////
TODO Applications embedded help ?
* What to set up when link:../../documentation/index.md#linking-to-help[linking to a `help`]
page.
////
* How to set up <<links-to-internal-documentation,links to internal documentation>>
  for cross-references.
* How to set up <<links-to-external-documentation,links to external documentation>>
  for authoritative sources.
// * When to use <<links-requiring-permissions,links requiring permissions>>.
* How to set up a <<link-to-video,link to a video>>.
* How to <<link-to-specific-lines-of-code,link to specific lines of code>>

[[docs:style:anchors]]
=== Anchor links

Headings generate anchor links when rendered: `== This is an example` generates
the anchor `#this-is-an-example`.

Keep in mind that:

* LinuxCNC user interfaces can link to documentation pages and anchor links
  to take the user to the right spot.
* Crosslinking is encouraged into documentation as part of the SSOT policy.

Thus, when you change a heading, search `docs/*` for the old anchor and
fix the possible broken links. +
If you do not fix these links, the link:../checkref[`checkref` script]
will choke and documentation build will fail.

Important:

* Avoid crosslinking documentation to headings unless you need to link to
  a specific section of the document. This avoids breaking anchors in the
  future in case the heading is changed.
* If possible, avoid changing headings, because they're not only linked
  internally. There are various links to LinuxCNC documentation on the
  internet, such as tutorials, presentations, forum posts, and other sources.
* Do not link to `h1` headings.

=== Basic link criteria

* Use inline URL macro `+https://example.com[Text]+`.
* Use meaningful anchor text. +
  For example, instead of writing something like `Read more about merge
  requests <url>[here]`, write `Read more about <url>[merge requests]`.
* Put the entire link on a single line. +
  Some tools do not work with links split over multiple lines, and incorrect
  or broken links could slip through and cause problems downstream.

=== Links to internal documentation

// TODO Anchor links `[[...]]` creation policy and pattern
//  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/

NOTE: *Internal* refers to documentation in the same repository. +
  When linking to documentation in separate projects (for example, linking
  to MesaCT or QtPyVCP), you must use absolute URLs.

Do not use absolute URLs like
`+https://linuxcnc.org/docs/stable/html/getting-started/about-linuxcnc.html[]+`
to cross-link to other documentation in the same project. +
Use relative links to the file like `+link:../getting-started/about-linuxcnc.adoc[]+`,
these are converted to HTML when the site is rendered.

Relative linking enables cross-links to work:

* In editors, review apps, and local previews.
* When working on the documentation locally, so you can verify that they
  work as early as possible in the process.
////
TODO apps embedded help
* In the LinuxCNC user interfaces when browsing doc files in their respective
  repositories. For example, the links displayed at
  `+https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/README.md+`.
////

To link to internal documentation:

* Use relative links to AsciiDoc files in the same repository.
* Do not use absolute URLs or URLs from `https://linuxcnc.org/docs/`.
* Use `../` to navigate to higher-level directories.
* Don't prepend `./` to links to files or directories. +
  To link to a file in the same directory or one of its sub-directories,
  use the syntax `path/to/file.adoc`.
* Don't link relative to root. For example, `/getting-started/about-linuxcnc.adoc`.
* Always add the filename `file.adoc` at the end of the link with the
  `.adoc` extension, not `.html`.
+
Don't:

 ** `../../merge_requests/`
 ** `../../issues/tags.html`
 ** `../../issues/tags.html#stages`

+
Do:

 ** `../../merge_requests/index.md`
 ** `../../issues/tags.md`
 ** `../../issues/tags.md#stages`
 ** `issues/tags.md`

=== Links to external documentation

When possible, avoid links to external documentation. These links can easily
become outdated, and are difficult to maintain.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot[They lead to link rot].
* They create issues with maintenance.

Sometimes links are required. They might clarify troubleshooting steps or
help prevent duplication of content. +
Sometimes they are more precise and will be maintained more actively.

For each external link you add, weigh the user benefit with the maintenance
difficulties.

////
=== Links requiring permissions

Don't link directly to:

* xref:../../../user/project/issues/confidential_issues.adoc[Confidential issues].
* Project features that require xref:../../../user/permissions.adoc[special permissions]
to view.

These fail for:

* Those without sufficient permissions.
* Automated link checkers.

Instead:

* To reduce confusion, mention in the text that the information is either:
 ** Contained in a confidential issue.
 ** Requires special permission to a project to view.
* Provide a link in back ticks (```) so that those with access to the issue
can navigate to it.

Example:

`+markdown
For more information, see the [confidential issue](../../../user/project/issues/confidential_issues.md) `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/<issue_number>`.
+`
////

=== Link to specific lines of code

When linking to specific lines in a file, link to a commit instead of to
the branch. Lines of code change over time. Linking to a line by using
the commit link ensures the user lands on the line you're referring to.
The *Permalink* button, displayed when viewing a file in a project,
provides a link to the most recent commit of that file.

* Do: `+https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/blob/e11daeb96779ebdeb7a811e2034b40dabbd45cbb/docs/src/getting-started/about-linuxcnc.adoc?plain=1#L3[link to line 3].+`
* Don't: `+https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/blob/master/docs/src/getting-started/about-linuxcnc.adoc?plain=1#L3[link to line 3]+`

If that linked expression has changed line numbers due to additional
commits, you can still search the file for that query. In this case, update
the document to ensure it links to the most recent version of the file.


[[docs:style:navigation]]
== Navigation

When documenting how to navigate through the LinuxCNC UIs:

* Always use location, then action.
 ** From the *File* menu (location), select *Open...* (action).
* Be brief and specific. +
  For example:
  ** Do: Select *Save*.
  ** Do not: Select *Save* for the changes to take effect.
* If a step must include a reason, start the step with it. +
  This helps the user scan more quickly.
  ** Do: To view the changes, in the merge request, select the link.
  ** Do not: Select the link in the merge request to view the changes.
* Use ordered lists to describe sequences of operations.

////
TODO === Names for menus

Use these terms when referring to the main LinuxCNC user interface
elements:

FIXME UIs bars: Menu bar, Tool bar, Status bar, other(s) ?
* *Top bar*: This is the top bar that spans the width of the user interface.
  It includes the menu, the LinuxCNC logo, search field, counters, and the user's avatar.
* *Left sidebar*: This is the navigation sidebar on the left of the user
  interface, specific to the project or group.
* *Right sidebar*: This is the navigation sidebar on the right of the user
  interface, specific to the open issue, merge request, or epic.
////

=== Names for UI elements

// TODO https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/ui-macros/
UI elements, like button and checkbox names, should be *`monotype bold`*.

----
Click the *`Open`* button.
----

Which will render as:

TODO Navigation tasks templates
To be consistent, use these templates when you write navigation steps in
a task topic.

To open project settings:

----
. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects** and find your project.
. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > CI/CD**.
. Expand **General pipelines**.
----

To open group settings:

----
. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Groups** and find your group.
. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > CI/CD**.
. Expand **General pipelines**.
----

To open the Admin Area:

----
. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
----

To select your avatar:

----
. On the top bar, in the top right corner, select your avatar.
----

To save the selection in some dropdown lists:

----
. Go to your issue.
. On the right sidebar, in the **Iteration** section, select **Edit**.
. From the dropdown list, select the iteration to associate this issue with.
. Select any area outside the dropdown list.
----
////

=== Optional steps

If a step is optional, start the step with the word `Optional` followed
by a period.

For example:

----
. Optional. Enter a description for the job.
----

=== Recommended steps

If a step is recommended, start the step with the word `Recommended` followed
by a period.

For example:

----
. Recommended. Enter a description for the job.
----

=== Documenting multiple fields at once

If the UI text sufficiently explains the fields in a section, do not include
a task step for every field. +
Instead, summarize multiple fields in a single task step.

Use the phrase *Complete the fields*.

// TODO Replace by an actual LinuxCNC example, like in Axis
For example:

. On the top bar, select menu:Main menu[Projects] and find your project.
. On the left sidebar, select menu:Settings[Repository].
. Expand *Push rules*.
. Complete the fields.

If you are documenting multiple fields and only one field needs explanation,
do it in the same step with a forced line break:

. Expand *Push rules*.
. Complete the fields. +
  *Branch name* must be a regular expression.

To describe multiple fields, use unordered list items:

. Expand *General pipelines*.
. Complete the fields.
  ** *Branch name* must be a regular expression.
  ** *User* must be a user with at least the *Maintainer* role.


[[docs:style:images]]
== Images

Images, including screenshots, can help a reader better understand a concept.
However, they should be used sparingly because:

* They tend to become out-of-date.
* They are difficult and expensive to localize.
* They cannot be read by screen readers.

When needed, use images to help the reader understand:

* Where they are in a complicated process.
* How they should interact with the application.

[[docs:style:captures]]
=== Screen captures

When you take screenshots:

* *Ensure it provides value.* +
  Don't use `lorem ipsum` text. +
  Try to replicate how the feature would be used in a real-world scenario,
  and <<docs:style:fake,use realistic text>>.
* *Capture only the relevant UI.* +
  Don't include unnecessary white space or areas of the UI that don't help
  illustrate the point. +
  Some parts of the UIs can change, so don't include them in screenshots
  unless absolutely necessary.
* *Keep it small.* +
  If you don't need to show the full width of the screen, don't. +
  Reduce the size of the application window as much as possible to keep
  elements close together and reduce empty space. +
  Try to keep the screenshot dimensions as small as possible.
* *Review how the image renders on the page.* +
  Preview the image locally or use the preview on GitHub once pushed. +
  Make sure the image isn't blurry or overwhelming.
* *Be consistent.* +
  Coordinate screenshots with the other screenshots already on a documentation
  page for a consistent reading experience. +
  Ensure you use the default preferences for appearance and UI themes.

=== Add callouts

If you need to emphasize an area in a screenshot, use an arrow.

* For color, use `#EE2604`.
* For the line width, use 3 pt.
* Use the simple triangular plain arrow style.
* If you have multiple arrows, make them parallel when possible.

=== Save the image

* Resize any wide or tall screenshots if needed, but make sure the screenshot
  is still clear after being resized and compressed.
* All images *must* be <<docs:style:compress,compressed>> to 100KB or less.+
  In many cases, 25-50KB or less is often possible without reducing image
  quality.
* Save the image with a lowercase filename that's descriptive of the feature
  or concept in the image:
  ** If the image is of an application interface append the LinuxCNC version
     to the filename based on this format: `image_name_vX_Y.png`. +
     If the application version differs for LinuxCNC's, use the former one.
     For example, for a screenshot taken from the Axis UI of LinuxCNC 2.8.4,
     a valid name is `axis_v2_8_4.png`.
  ** If you're adding an illustration that doesn't include parts of the
     user interface, add the release number corresponding to the release
     the image was added to. +
     For a PR added to future 2.9.0 version, a valid name for an illustration
     is `components_diagram_v2_9_0.png`.
* Place images in a separate directory named `img/` in the same directory
  where the `.adoc` document that you're working on is located.
* Consider using PNG images instead of JPEG.
// TODO Propose FOSS alternative solutions to compress GIFs
* Images should be used (only when necessary) to illustrate the description
  of a process, not to replace it.
* See also how to link and embed <<docs:style:videos,videos>> to illustrate
  the documentation.

=== Insert the image into content

// TODO Expand block image insertion infos
//   https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html#_block_macros
//   https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/
The AsciiDoc code for including an image in a document is:

----
`image::img/document_image_title_vX_Y.png["Image description which will be the alt tag"]`
----

The image description is the alt text for the rendered image on the
documentation site. +
For accessibility and SEO, use https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/[descriptions]
that:

* Are accurate, succinct, and unique.
* Don't use *image of* or *graphic of* to describe the image.

// TODO Add inline image insertion infos
//   https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html#_inline_macros

[[docs:style:compress]]
=== Compress images

You should always compress any new images you add to the documentation.

One known tool is https://pngquant.org/[`pngquant`], which is cross-platform
and open source. Install it by visiting the official website and/or following
the instructions for your OS.

////
TODO Use GitLab's or provide our images compression helper script

If you use macOS and want all screenshots to be compressed automatically, read
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/30/simple-trick-for-smaller-screenshots/[One simple trick to make your screenshots 80% smaller].

GitLab has a https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/bin/pngquant[Ruby script]
that you can use to simplify the manual process. In the root directory of
your local copy of `+https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab+`, run in a terminal:

* Before compressing, if you want, check that all documentation PNG images have
been compressed:
+
----
bin/pngquant lint
----

* Compress all documentation PNG images using `pngquant`:
+
----
bin/pngquant compress
----

* Compress specific files:
+
----
bin/pngquant compress doc/user/img/award_emoji_select.png doc/user/img/markdown_logo.png
`

* Compress all PNG files in a specific directory:
+
----
bin/pngquant compress doc/user/img
----
////

Compress GIFs with https://ezgif.com/optimize or similar tool.

=== Animated images

Avoid using animated images (such as animated GIFs). They can be distracting
and annoying for users, and they will be fixed in printed form.

If you're describing a complicated interaction in the user interface and
want to include a visual representation to help readers understand it, you
can:

* Use a static image (screenshot) and if necessary, add callouts to emphasize
  an area of the screen.
* Create a short video of the interaction and link to it.

////
TODO Emojis
== Emojis

Don't use the AsciiDoc emoji format, for example `:smile:`, for any purpose. Use
<<gitlab-svg-icons,LinuxCNC SVG icons>> instead.

Use of emoji in AsciiDoc requires LinuxCNC Flavored AsciiDoc, which is not supported by Kramdown,
the AsciiDoc rendering engine used for LinuxCNC documentation.

== Icons

////
TODO LinuxCNC Icons
____
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/issues/384[Introduced] in GitLab 12.7.
____

You can use icons from the https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/[GitLab SVG library]
directly in the documentation. For example, `+**{tanuki}**+` renders as: *\{tanuki}*.

TODO Icons substitution attributes like {edit} or {trash}
////

In most cases, you should avoid using the icons in text.

However, you can use an icon when hover text is the only available way to
describe a UI element. +
For example, *Delete* or *Edit* buttons often have hover text only.

When you do use an icon, start with the hover text and follow it with the
inline icon:

* Avoid: `+Select image:pencil.svg[] *Edit*.+` +
  This generates as: Select image:pencil.svg[] *Edit*.
* Use instead: `+Select *Edit* (image:pencil.svg[]).+` +
  This generates as: Select *Edit* (image:pencil.svg[]).

Do not use words to describe the icon:

* Avoid: `+Select *Erase job log* (the trash icon).+`
* Use instead: `+Select *Erase job log* (image:remove.svg[]).+` +
  This generates as: Select *Erase job log* (image:remove.svg[]).

[[docs:style:videos]]
== Videos

Adding LinuxCNC YouTube video tutorials to the documentation is highly
encouraged, unless the video is outdated. Videos should not replace
documentation, but complement or illustrate it. If content in a video is
fundamental to a feature and its key use cases, but isn't adequately
covered in the documentation, you should:

* Add this detail to the documentation text.
* Create an issue to review the video and update the page.

Do not upload videos to the product repositories. <<link-to-video,Link>> or
<<embed-videos,embed>> them instead.

=== Link to video

To link out to a video, include a YouTube icon so that readers can scan
the page for videos before reading:

`markdown
<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
For an overview, see [Video Title](link-to-video).
`

You can link any up-to-date video that's useful to the LinuxCNC user.

=== Embed videos

____
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/merge_requests/472[Introduced] in Gitlab 12.1.
____

The https://docs.gitlab.com[LinuxCNC documentation site] supports embedded
videos.

You can embed videos from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg[the official YouTube account for LinuxCNC] only.
For videos from other sources, <<link-to-video,link>> them instead.

In most cases, <<link-to-video,link to a video>>, because embedded videos
take up a lot of space on the page and can be distracting to readers.

To embed a video:

. Copy the code from this procedure and paste it into your AsciiDoc file. +
  Leave a blank line above and below it. +
  Do not edit the code (don't remove or add any spaces). +
. In YouTube, visit the video URL you want to display. +
  Copy the regular URL from your browser
  (`+https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO-ID+`) and replace the video
  title and link in the line under `<div class="video-fallback">`.
. In YouTube, select *Share*, and then select *Embed*.
. Copy the `<iframe>` source (`src`) *URL only*
  (`+https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO-ID+`), and paste it, replacing
  the content of the `src` field in the `iframe` tag.

Notes:

* The `figure` tag is required for semantic SEO
* `video-container` class is necessary to make sure the video is responsive
  and displays on different mobile devices.
* The `<div class="video-fallback">` is a fallback necessary for `/help`,
  because the GitLab Markdown processor doesn't support iframes. It's

[[docs:style:admonitions]]
== Admonitions

// https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html#X28
// https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/admonitions/

Use admonition boxes to call attention to information.

Use them sparingly, and never have an alert box immediately follow another
alert box.

Single paragraph admonitions are generated when one of these uppercase
labels is used as a style attribute:

* `NOTE`
* `TIP`
* `IMPORTANT`
* `CAUTION`
* `WARNING`
// FIXME No DISCLAIMER, nor FLAG or INFO

Lines of the paragraph should be left aligned on the content of the first
line for better readability of the source.

For example:

[source,adoc]
----
[TIP]
Ain't that a useful tip ?!
----

Renders as:

[TIP]
Ain't that a useful tip ?!

[NOTE]
This form is preferred to the `LABEL:` prefix at the beginning of the paragraph
for consistency with the multi-block admonitions markup.

When you want to apply an admonition to more elaborate content, set the
label as a style attribute on an example block (`====`):

[source,adoc]
----
[NOTE]
.Admonition block can have titles
====
Admonition blocks allow for multi block content:

=== Flag

Use this alert type to describe a feature's availability. For information about how to format
`FLAG` alerts, see xref:../feature_flags.adoc[Document features deployed behind feature flags].

=== Note

Use notes sparingly. Too many notes can make topics difficult to scan.

Instead of adding a note:

* Re-write the sentence as part of a paragraph.
* Put the information into its own paragraph.
* Put the content under a new subheading.

If you must use a note, use this format:

[source,adoc]
NOTE: This is something to note.

It renders on the LinuxCNC documentation site as:

=== Tip

Use tips to add tricks and useful information from craft and experience.


If you must use a note, use this format:

TODO INFO admonition
=== Info

The Marketing team uses the `INFO` alert to add information relating to
sales and marketing efforts.

The text in an `INFO` alert always renders in a floating text box to the
right of the text around it. To view the rendered LinuxCNC docs site, check
the review app in the MR. You might need to move the text up or down in
the surrounding text, depending on where you'd like to floating box to
appear.

For example, if your page has text like this:

FIXME Do we want tabs in our documentation pages ?
  @silopolis: really no
== Tabs

On the docs site, you can format text so it's displayed as tabs.

To create a set of tabs, follow this example:

```plaintext
::Tabs

:::TabTitle Tab One

Here's some content in tab one.

:::TabTitle Tab Two

Here's some other content in tab two.

::EndTabs
```

This code renders on the LinuxCNC documentation site as:

::Tabs

:::TabTitle Tab One

Here's some content in tab one.

:::TabTitle Tab Two

Here's some other content in tab two.

::EndTabs

For tab titles, be brief and consistent. Ensure they are parallel, and start each with a capital letter.
For example:

* `Omnibus package`, `Helm chart`, `Source`
* `15.1 and earlier`, `15.2 and later`

See https://design.gitlab.com/components/tabs/#guidelines[Pajamas] for details.
////


[[docs:style:terms]]
== Terms

To maintain consistency through LinuxCNC documentation, use these styles
and terms.

=== Describe UI elements

Follow these styles when you're describing user interface elements in an
application:

* For elements with a visible label, use that label in bold with matching
  case. +
  For example: `+Select *Cancel*+`.
* For elements with a tooltip or hover label, use that label in bold with
  matching case. +
  For example: `+Select *Home All*+`.


[[docs:style:apps]]
== Applications, components and features

Refer to the information in this section when describing applications,
components and features in the LinuxCNC documentation.

=== Avoid line breaks in names

If an application, component, or feature name contains spaces, don't split
the name with a line break. +
When names change, it is more complicated to search or `grep` text that has
line breaks.


////
FIXME LinuxCNC specific sections ? styles ?
[[docs:style:special-sections]]
== Specific sections

Certain styles should be applied to specific sections. Styles for specific
sections are outlined in this section.

=== Installation guide

In link:../../../install/installation.md#2-ruby[step 2 of the installation guide],
we install Ruby from source. To update the guide for a new Ruby version:

* Change the version throughout the code block.
* Replace the sha256sum. It's available on the
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[downloads page] of the Ruby website.

=== Configuration documentation for source and Omnibus installations

LinuxCNC supports two installation methods: installations from source, and Omnibus
packages. Possible configuration settings include:

* Settings that touch configuration files in `config/`.
* NGINX settings.
* Other settings in `lib/support/`.

Configuration procedures can require users to edit configuration files, reconfigure
LinuxCNC, or restart LinuxCNC. Use these styles to document these steps, replacing
`PATH/TO` with the appropriate path:

[source,adoc]
----
*For Omnibus installations*

. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:
+
[source,ruby]
external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"

. Save the file and link:PATH/TO/administration/restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure[reconfigure]
LinuxCNC for the changes to take effect.

'''

*For installations from source*

. Edit `config/gitlab.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
gitlab:
  host: "gitlab.example.com"

. Save the file and link:PATH/TO/administration/restart_gitlab.md#installations-from-source[restart]
LinuxCNC for the changes to take effect.
----

In this case:

* Bold the installation method's name.
* Separate the methods with three dashes (`---`) to create a horizontal line.
* Indent the code blocks to line up with the list item they belong to..
* Use the appropriate syntax highlighting for each code block.
* Use the <<gitlab-restart,LinuxCNC Restart>> section to explain any required
restart or reconfigure of LinuxCNC.

=== LinuxCNC restart

When a restart or reconfigure of LinuxCNC is required, avoid duplication
by linking to link:../../../administration/restart_gitlab.adoc[`doc/administration/restart_gitlab.md`]
with text like this, replacing 'reconfigure' with 'restart' as needed:

`markdown
Save the file and [reconfigure LinuxCNC](../../../administration/restart_gitlab.md)
for the changes to take effect.
`

If the document resides outside of the `doc/` directory, use the full path
instead of the relative link:
`+https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/restart_gitlab.html+`.
