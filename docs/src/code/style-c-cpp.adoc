= C/C++ Coding Standards

Most of this style guide has been copied wholesale from the Linux kernel
documents - See linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for the full text.
The C++ recommendations have been drawn from various sources such as the
GTK headers, "C++ The Complete Reference" by Schildt, and IRC discussions.

== Tab Stops

A tab stop always corresponds to 8 spaces. Do not write code that
displays correctly only with a differing tab stop setting.

== Indentation

Use 4 spaces per level of indentation. Combining 8 spaces into one tab
is acceptable but not required.

Rationale: The whole idea behind indentation is to clearly define where
a block of control starts and ends.  Especially when you've been looking
at your screen for 20 straight hours, you'll find it a lot easier to see
how the indentation works if you have large indentations.

Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes
the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a
80-character terminal screen. Whilst the GNU style of 2-character
indentations reduces the clarity. For EMC2, a compromise of 4-character
indentation has been chosen. This still spreads the code out and causes
lines to wrap round leading to difficulties in reading the sources. The
answer to that is that if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're
screwed anyway, and should fix your program.

== Placing Braces

The other issue that always comes up in C styling is the placement of
braces.  Unlike the indent size, there are few technical reasons to
choose one placement strategy over the other, but the preferred way, as
shown to us by the prophets Kernighan and Ritchie, is to put the opening
brace last on the line, and put the closing brace first, thusly:

[source,c]
----
if (x is true) {
    we do y
}
----

However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus:

[source,c]
----
int function(int x)
{
    body of function
}
----

Note that the closing brace is empty on a line of its own, _except_ in
the cases where it is followed by a continuation of the same statement,
i.e. a "while" in a do-statement or an "else" in an if-statement, like
this:

[source,c]
----
do {
    body of do-loop
} while (condition);
----

and

[source,c]
----
if (x == y) {
    ..
} else if (x > y) {
    ...
} else {
    ....
}
----
Also, note that this brace-placement also minimizes the number of empty
(or almost empty) lines, without any loss of readability.  Thus, as the
supply of new-lines on your screen is not a renewable resource (think
25-line terminal screens here), you have more empty lines to put
comments on.

== Naming

C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be. Unlike Modula-2
and Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like
ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter. A C programmer would call that
variable 'tmp', which is much easier to write, and not the least more
difficult to understand.

However, descriptive names for global variables are a must. To call a
global function 'foo' is a shooting offense.

GLOBAL variables (to be used only if you *really*  need them) need to
have descriptive names, as do global functions. If
you have a function that counts the number of active users, you should
 call that 'count_active_users()' or similar, you should *not* call it
'cntusr()'.

Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian
notation) is brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and
can check those, and it only confuses the programmer. No wonder
Microsoft makes buggy programs.

LOCAL variable names should be short, and to the point. If you have
some random integer loop counter, it should probably be called 'i'.
Calling it 'loop_counter' is non-productive, if there is no chance of
it being misunderstood. Similarly, 'tmp' can be just about any type of
variable that is used to hold a temporary value.

If you are afraid to mix up your local variable names, you have
another problem, which is called the function-growth-hormone-imbalance
syndrome. See next chapter.

== Functions

Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing. They
should fit on one or two screenfuls of text (the ISO/ANSI screen size
is 80x24, as we all know), and do one thing and do that well.

The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the
complexity and indentation level of that function. So, if you have a
conceptually simple function that is just one long (but simple)
case-statement, where you have to do lots of small things for a lot of
different cases, it's OK to have a longer function.

However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a
less-than-gifted first-year high-school student might not even
understand what the function is all about, you should adhere to the
maximum limits all the more closely. Use helper functions with
descriptive names (you can ask the compiler to in-line them if you
think it's performance-critical, and it will probably do a better job
of it that you would have done).

Another measure of the function is the number of local variables. They
shouldn't exceed 5-10, or you're doing something wrong. Re-think the
function, and split it into smaller pieces. A human brain can generally
easily keep track of about 7 different things, anything more and it
gets confused. You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like to
understand what you did 2 weeks from now.

== Commenting

Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting.
NEVER try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it's much better
to write the code so that the *working* is obvious, and it's a waste of
time to explain badly written code.

Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not
HOW. A boxed comment describing the function, return value, and who
calls it placed above the body is good. Also, try to avoid putting
comments inside a function body: if the function is so complex that you
need to separately comment parts of it, you should probably re-read the
Functions section again. You can make small comments to note or warn
about something particularly clever (or ugly), but try to avoid excess.
Instead, put the comments at the head of the function, telling people
what it does, and possibly WHY it does it.

If comments along the lines of /* Fix me */ are used, please, please,
say why something needs fixing. When a change has been made to the
affected portion of code, either remove the comment, or amend it to
indicate a change has been made and needs testing.

== Shell Scripts & Makefiles

Not everyone has the same tools and packages installed. Some people
use vi, others emacs - A few even avoid having either package
installed, preferring a lightweight text editor such as nano or the one
built in to Midnight Commander.

gawk versus mawk - Again, not everyone will have gawk installed, mawk
is nearly a tenth of the size and yet conforms to the POSIX AWK
standard. If some obscure gawk specific command is needed that mawk
does not provide, than the script will break for some users. The same
would apply to mawk. In short, use the generic awk invocation in
preference to gawk or mawk.

== C++ Conventions

C++ coding styles are always likely to end up in heated debates (a bit
like the emacs versus vi arguments). One thing is certain however, a
common style used by everyone working on a project leads to uniform and
readable code.

Naming conventions: Constants either from #defines or enumerations
should be in upper case through out. Rationale: Makes it easier to spot
compile time constants in the source code, e.g., EMC_MESSAGE_TYPE.

Classes and Namespaces should capitalize the first letter of each word
and avoid underscores. Rationale: Identifies classes, constructors and
destructors, e.g., GtkWidget.

Methods (or function names) should follow the C recommendations above
and should not include the class name. Rationale: Maintains a common
style across C and C++ sources, e.g., get_foo_bar().

However, boolean methods are easier to read if they avoid underscores
and use an 'is' prefix (not to be confused with methods that manipulate
a boolean). Rationale: Identifies the return value as TRUE or FALSE and
nothing else, e.g., isOpen, isHomed.

Do NOT use 'Not' in a boolean name, it leads only leads to confusion
when doing logical tests, e.g., isNotOnLimit or is_not_on_limit are BAD.

Variable names should avoid the use of upper case and underscores
except for local or private names. The use of global variables should
be avoided as much as possible. Rationale: Clarifies which are
variables and which are methods. Public: e.g., axislimit Private: e.g.,
maxvelocity_ .

.Specific method naming conventions

The terms get and set should be used where an attribute is accessed
directly. Rationale: Indicates the purpose of the function or method,
e.g., get_foo set_bar.

For methods involving boolean attributes, set & reset is preferred.
Rationale: As above. e.g. set_amp_enable reset_amp_fault

Math intensive methods should use compute as a prefix. Rationale:
Shows that it is computationally intensive and will hog the CPU. e.g.
compute_PID

Abbreviations in names should be avoided where possible - The
exception is for local variable names. Rationale: Clarity of code. e.g.
pointer is preferred over ptr compute is preferred over cmp compare is
again preferred over cmp.

Enumerates and other constants can be prefixed by a common type name,
e.g., `enum COLOR { COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLUE };` .

Excessive use of macros and defines should be avoided - Using simple
methods or functions is preferred. Rationale: Improves the debugging
process.

Include Statements Header files must be included at the top of a
source file and not scattered throughout the body. They should be
sorted and grouped by their hierarchical position within the system
with the low level files included first. Include file paths should
NEVER be absolute - Use the compiler -I flag instead to extend the search
path. Rationale: Headers may not be in the same place on all systems.

Pointers and references should have their reference symbol next to the
variable name rather than the type name. Rationale: Reduces confusion,
e.g., `float *x` or `int &i`.

Implicit tests for zero should not be used except for boolean
variables, e.g., `if (spindle_speed != 0)` NOT `if (spindle_speed)`.

Only loop control statements must be included in a for() construct,
e.g.

[source,c]
----
sum = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    sum += value[i];
}
----

NOT:

[source,c]
----
for (i = 0, sum = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    sum += value[i];
}
----

Likewise, executable statements in conditionals must be avoided, e.g.,
`if (fd = open(file_name))` is bad.

Complex conditional statements should be avoided - Introduce temporary
boolean variables instead.

The form `while(true)`` should be used for infinite loops.
e.g.

[source,c]
----
while (true) {
    ...;
}
----

NOT

[source,c]
----
for (;;) {
    ...;
}
----

or

[source,c]
----
while (1) {
    ...;
}
----

Parentheses should be used in plenty in mathematical expressions - Do
not rely on operator precedence when an extra parentheses would clarify
things.

File names: C++ sources and headers use .cc and .hh extension. The use
of .c and .h are reserved for plain C. Headers are for class, method,
and structure declarations, not code (unless the functions are declared
inline).
