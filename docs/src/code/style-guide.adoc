= Coding Style

== General comments

LinuxCNC _components and applications_ developed in *C/C++*, *Python*, *BASH*
and *Tcl/Tk*.

_Documentation_ is written in *AsciiDoc*, and the UNIX _man pages_ are written
in *Groff*.

These programming languages are not completely independent from each other:
the scripting languages extend the LinuxCNC C/C++ core for easier adaption
of user interfaces.

Every programming language has its very own syntax and structure standards
and customs, and as many flavours as opinionated developers about their
very own being the best. And while the exact style does not matter too much,
it is important for the eye to see the source code formatted consistently.

These chapters hence describe the source code style preferred by the LinuxCNC
team. This shall improve the readability of source code and documentation
and shall avoid intensive discussions (aka bike-shedding) about how to style
it best.


=== Do No Harm

When making small edits to code in a style different than the one described
below, _observe the local coding style_. Rapid changes from one coding style
to another decrease code readability.

Never check in code after running "indent" on it. The whitespace changes
introduced by indent make it more difficult to follow the revision history
of the file.

Do not use an editor that makes unneeded changes to whitespace (e.g., which
replaces 8 spaces with a tabstop on a line not otherwise modified, or word-wraps
lines not otherwise modified).
