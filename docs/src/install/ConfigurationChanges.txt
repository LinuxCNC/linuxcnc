== Rationale for reworking the LinuxCNC configuration options

Up to now configuration options for LinuxCNC regarding 'real time
environments' are:

--enable-simulator:: - userland threads, HAL components are `.so` dynamic shared objects, 
--with-realtime=<rtai config directory>:: RTAI - kernel threads, HAL components are .ko kernel modules
--with-realtime=<rtl config directory>:: RT linux - kernel threads , HAL components are `.ko` kernel modules (deprecated, since RT Linux is pretty much dead)

The underlying assumptions at the time likely were: 

* a realtime enviroment uses kernel modules
* a system with userland threads and .so dynamic shared objects is not suited for real applications, just a 'simulator'
* consequently the simulator has no hardware drivers, since it is, well, a simulator and hence useless for real work.
* a simulator does not do any hardware I/O, so there is no need I/O access and hence for setuid root programs (ioperm(2))

Several options for realtime Linux have appeared since, which are:

* Linux with the RT_PREEMPT kernel patch, to improve latency but otherwise remain with the user process programming paradigm - with some 'RT fortification system calls' peppered in

* Xenomai, which is similar to RTAI with it's hypervisor approach to  RT threads, but supports BOTH a kernel and a user process paradigm for 'realtime processes', albeit with a slight performance advantage  for in-kernel processes.

These two platforms provide new options:

* With RT_PREEMPT, the current 'simulator process' (rtapi_app) becomes
  'realtime fortified' (locking down memory, setting scheduling priorities etc) but otherwise remains a user process; see for instance the current hardened rtapi_app for rt-preempt:  http://git.mah.priv.at/gitweb/emc2-dev.git/blob/6640ed5d6ef20c582bf515a7ac7eb527ce486e19:/src/rtapi/linux_rtapi_app.cc

* while the option so far has not explored in the context of LinuxCNC, it seems entirely reasonable to employ normal Linux kernel threads for RTAPI functions; this has been done in the past, for instance with KHTTPD (in-kernel HTTP server to improve performance), and would be an interesting route to explore with RT_PREEMPT.

* with Xenomai, both paradigms are possible: kernel RT threads and kernel modules,  as well as userland RT threads and .so shared object modules

Also, given reasonable latency of one of the user RT process schemes, it becomes entirely feasible to use user-mode device drivers.

These new options cannot be consistently
adressed with the current configuration assumptions. Realtime does not
imply kernel threads exclusively anymore, and User process mode does
not imply 'useless so no drivers' please.  Also, user RT modules will do I/O, hence rtapi_app needs to be setuid root in this case. 

As work progresses on different branches in parallel, configuration
problems will likely be solved ad-hoc and conflicts  will
arise during merge, also with the consequence of an even more incoherent set of options.

=== The new option space 

The basic idea is to describe the build from the following angles:

* the `thread style` - whether userland- or kernel threads are used,
and which RT platform is employed if hard RT behaviour is desired
* the `module build system` - either kernel modules, or user dynamic
shared objects; this parameter is derived from the thread style.
* whether hardware drivers should be built, or not

All three parameters are reflected in Shell/Makefile
variables, replacements in '*.in' files as needed, and also as
`#defines` in config.h.


=== The old option space 

The following symbols/shell/Makefile variables have been removed:

SIM, SIMULATOR, RTAPI_SIM, sim::  lost its meaning, removed.

rtl:: RT Linux support has been removed - RT Linux is dead.

--with-realtime:: deprecated.

The 'normal' build system is not used anymore.

=== Options of unclear status

* PowerPC architecture: src/Makefile contains the following line:

  Makefile:IS_POWERPC = test `uname -m` = ppc -o `uname -m` = ppc64


=== Kernel autodetection

The new method assumes that the target kernel (which is built for) is
'installed'; it need not necessarily be the running kernel, but
'runtests' will only succeed if the target kernel is running. A build
machine therefore should have all the desired target kernels installed.

To autodetect the kernel style (RTAI, Xenomai, RT_PREEMPT patches to
generic kernel), the kernel config files under
'/boot/config-<kernel-version>' are investigated for typical option combinations.

To force build for a specific kernel version, use '--with-kernel' like
so:

  ./configure --with-kernel=/boot/config-2.6.32-122-rtai

=== New configuration options to support different realtime kernels

(for now, this only applies to http://git.mah.priv.at/gitweb/emc2-dev.git/shortlog/refs/heads/integration-configuration-dev as it is not merged yet):

==== The thread style

--with-threads=<arg>:: 'arg' being one of:

* `posix`: will be implied by the current '--enable-simulator' option, meaning: simulator rtapi_app, no RT hardening, user mode .so modules

* `rt-preempt-user`: as above, but hardened rtapi_app.

* `rt-preempt-kernel`: this would imply: an rt-preempt kernel,  kthreads for RTAPI execution, and .ko modules.

* `xenomai-user`: as posix, but using xenomai user RT process hardening (rouhgly as used in the miniemc2 project: http://code.google.com/p/miniemc2/)

* `xenomai-kernel`: very similar to current RTAI threads.

* `rtai`: as before

The thread style is reflected in the THREADS shell/Makefile variable;
in config.h as one of the following defined:

`RTAPI_POSIX` `RTAPI_RT_PREEMPT_USER` `RTAPI_RT_PREEMPT_KERNEL`
`RTAPI_XENOMAI_USER` `RTAPI_XENOMAI_KERNEL` `RTAPI_RTAI`

==== the Build system

There are two build styles:

* 'kbuild' (kernel modules) 
* 'user-dso' (userland dynamic shared objects). 

The thread style implies a build system: 'posix', 'xenomai-user',
'rt-preempt-user' imply 'user-dso', the others imply 'kbuild'. 

The used build system is reflected as follows:

* shell/Makefile:  `BUILD_SYS` - possible values: `kbuild` or `user-dso`
* config.h: either `BUILD_SYSTEM_KBUILD` or `BUILD_SYSTEM_USER_DSO` defined.


==== Building hardware drivers

Building hardware drivers can be explicitly controlled with
'--enable-drivers'. This  defaults to 'yes' except for '--with-threads=posix' (what used
to be the 'simulator' configuration). 

Some hardware drivers will build as kernel modules only, some as user shared objects, some may build as both; in that case the Submakefile needs to test for `BUILD_SYS` having the proper value.

This option is reflected as `BUILD_DRIVERS`=yes/no in shell/Makefile
and  conditionally defined as macro in config.h .

== Make setuid ==

This has been adapted to take care of the case where userland drivers
are used - here rtapi_app needs to be setuid root to gain IO
permissions.

== Configuration examples

 ./configure --enable-simulator::  as before - Posix userland threads,
no hardware drivers

 ./configure --enable-simulator --enable-drivers:: Posix userland
threads, enable drivers which can run in userspace

 ./configure:: build for the current kernel - autodetect the RT thread
style . Defaults to --with-threads=posix if neither an RTAI, Xenomai
or RT_PREEMPT kernel was found.

 ./configure --with-threads=rt-preempt-user  --with-kernel=/boot/config-3.4.13-rt-preempt-rt22+ :: explicitly select kernel version and thread style

 ./configure --with-threads=xenomai-user  --with-kernel=/boot/config-2.6.38.8-xenomai+:: explicitly  select kernel version and thread style


== TODO

debian/configure still needs to be adapted.
