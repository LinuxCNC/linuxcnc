= weighted_sum(9)

== NAME

weighted_sum - convert a group of bits to an integer

== SYNOPSIS

**loadrt weighted_sum wsum_sizes=**__size__[,__size__,...]

Creates weighted sum groups each with the given number of input bits (_size_).

== DESCRIPTION

The weighted_sum converts a group of bits to an integer. The conversion
is the sum of the weights of the bits that are on plus any offset. The
weight of the m-th bit is 2^m. This is similar to a binary coded decimal
but with more options. The hold bit stops processing the input changes
so the sum will not change.

The default value for each weight is 2^m where m is the bit number.
This results in a binary to unsigned conversion.

There is a limit of 8 weighted summers and each may have up to 16 input bits.

== FUNCTIONS

*process_wsums* (requires a floating point thread)::
  Read all input values and update all output values.

== PINS

**wsum.**_N_**.bit.**_M_**.in** bit in::
  The __m__^th^ input of weighted summer _n_.
**wsum.**_N_**.hold** bit in::
  When TRUE, the _sum_ output does not change.
  When FALSE, the _sum_ output tracks the _bit_ inputs according to the weights and offset.
**wsum.**_N_**.sum** signed out::
  The output of the weighted summer.
**wsum.**_N_**.bit.**_M_**.weight** signed rw::
  The weight of the __m__^th^ input of weighted summer _n_.
  The default value is 2^__m__^.
**wsum.**_N_**.offset** signed rw::
  The offset is added to the weights corresponding to all TRUE inputs to give the final sum.
