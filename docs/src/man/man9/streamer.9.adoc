== NAME
streamer - stream file data into HAL in real time

== SYNOPSIS
*loadrt streamer depth*=_depth1[,depth2...]_ *cfg*=_string1[,string2...]_

== DESCRIPTION

*streamer* and *halstreamer(1)* are used together to stream data from a file into the HAL in real time.
*streamer* is a realtime HAL component that exports HAL pins and creates a FIFO in shared memory.
*hal_streamer* is a non-realtime program that copies data from stdin into the FIFO, so that *streamer* can write it to the HAL pins.

== OPTIONS

*depth*=_depth1[,depth2...]_::

    Sets the depth of the FIFO that the realtime *streamer* creates to receive data from the non-realtime *hal-streamer*.
    Multiple values of _depth_ (separated by commas) can be specified if you need more than one FIFO (for example if you want to stream data to two different realtime threads).

*cfg*=_string1[,string2...]_::

    Defines the set of HAL pins that *streamer* exports and later writes data to.
    One _string_ must be supplied for each FIFO, separated by commas.
    *streamer* exports one pin for each character in _string_.
    Legal characters are:

        * *F*, *f* (float pin)
        * *B*, *b* (bit pin)
        * *S*, *s* (s32 pin)
        * *U*, *u* (u32 pin)

== FUNCTIONS
*streamer*._N_::
One function is created per FIFO, numbered from zero.

== PINS

*streamer*._N_.*pin*._M_ output::
    Data from column _M_ of the data in FIFO _N_ appears on this pin.
    The pin type depends on the config string.

*streamer*._N_.*curr-depth* s32 output::
    Current number of samples in the FIFO.
    When this reaches zero, new data will no longer be written to the pins.

*streamer*._N_.*empty* bit output::
    TRUE when the FIFO _N_ is empty, FALSE when valid data is available.

*streamer*._N_.*enable* bit input::
    When TRUE, data from FIFO _N_ is written to the HAL pins.
    When false, no data is transferred.  Defaults to TRUE.

*streamer*._N_.*underruns* s32 read/write::
    The number of times that *sampler* has tried to write data to the HAL pins but found no fresh data in the FIFO.
    It increments whenever *empty* is true, and can be reset by the *setp* command.

*streamer*._N_.*clock bit input::
    Clock for data as specified by the clock-mode pin.

*streamer*._N_.*clock-mode s32 input::
    Defines behavior of clock pin:

      * 0 (*default*) free run at every iteration
      * 1 clock on falling edge of clock pin
      * 2 clock on rising edge of clock pin
      * 3 clock on any edge of clock pin

== BUGS
Should an enable HAL pin be added, to allow streaming to be turned on and off?
