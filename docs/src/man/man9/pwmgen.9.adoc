== NAME

pwmgen - software PWM/PDM generation

== SYNOPSIS

**loadrt pwmgen output_type=**_type0_[,_type1_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*pwmgen* is used to generate PWM (pulse width modulation) or PDM (pulse
density modulation) signals. The maximum PWM frequency and the
resolution is quite limited compared to hardware-based approaches, but
in many cases software PWM can be very useful. If better performance is
needed, a hardware PWM generator is a better choice.

*pwmgen* supports a maximum of eight channels. The number of channels
actually loaded depends on the number of _type_ values given. The value
of each _type_ determines the outputs for that channel.

type 0: single output::
  A single output pin, *pwm*, whose duty cycle is
determined by the input value for positive inputs, and which is off (or
at *min-dc*) for negative inputs. Suitable for single ended circuits.
type 1: pwm/direction::
  Two output pins, *pwm* and *dir*. The duty cycle on *pwm* varies as a
  function of the input value. *dir* is low for positive inputs and high
  for negative inputs.
type 2: up/down::
  Two output pins, *up* and *down*. For positive inputs, the PWM/PDM
  waveform appears on *up*, while *down* is low. For negative inputs,
  the waveform appears on *down*, while *up* is low. Suitable for
  driving the two sides of an H-bridge to generate a bipolar output.

== FUNCTIONS

*pwmgen.make-pulses* (no floating-point)::
  Generates the actual PWM waveforms, using information computed by
  *update*. Must be called as frequently as possible, to maximize the
  attainable PWM frequency and resolution, and minimize jitter. Operates
  on all channels at once.
*pwmgen.update* (uses floating point)::
  Accepts an input value, performs scaling and limit checks, and
  converts it into a form usable by *make-pulses* for PWM/PDM
  generation. Can (and should) be called less frequently than
  *make-pulses*. Operates on all channels at once.

== PINS

**pwmgen.**_N_**.enable** bit in::
  Enables PWM generator _N_ - when false, all **pwmgen.**_N_ output pins are low.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.value** float in::
  Commanded value. When *value* = 0.0, duty cycle is 0%, and when
  *value* = ±**scale**, duty cycle is ± 100% (subject to *min-dc* and
  *max-dc* limitations).
**pwmgen.**_N_**.pwm* bit out (output types 0 and 1 only)::
  PWM/PDM waveform.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.dir** bit out (output type 1 only)::
  Direction output: low for forward, high for reverse.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.up** bit out (output type 2 only)::
  PWM/PDM waveform for positive input values, low for negative inputs.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.down** bit out (output type 2 only)::
  PWM/PDM waveform for negative input values, low for positive inputs.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.curr-dc** float out::
  The current duty cycle, after all scaling and limits have been applied.
  Range is from -1.0 to +1.0.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.max-dc** float in/out::
  The maximum duty cycle. A value of 1.0 corresponds to 100%.
  This can be useful when using transistor drivers with bootstrapped power supplies,
  since the supply requires some low time to recharge.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.min-dc** float in/out::
  The minimum duty cycle. A value of 1.0 corresponds to 100%.
  Note that when the pwm generator is disabled, the outputs are constantly low,
  regardless of the setting of *min-dc*.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.scale** float in/out::

**pwmgen.**_N_**.offset** float in/out::
  These parameters provide a scale and offset from the *value* pin to the actual duty cycle.
  The duty cycle is calculated according to _dc = (value/scale) + offset_, with 1.0 meaning 100%.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.pwm-freq** float in/out::
  PWM frequency in Hz. The upper limit is half of the frequency at which
  *make-pulses* is invoked, and values above that limit will be changed to the limit.
  If *dither-pwm* is false, the value will be changed to
  the nearest integer submultiple of the *make-pulses* frequency.
  A value of zero produces Pulse Density Modulation instead of Pulse Width Modulation.
**pwmgen.**_N_**.dither-pwm** bit in/out::
  Because software-generated PWM uses a fairly slow timebase (several to
  many microseconds), it has limited resolution. For example, if
  *make-pulses* is called at a 20 kHz rate, and *pwm-freq* is 2 kHz,
  there are only 10 possible duty cycles. If *dither-pwm* is false, the
  commanded duty cycle will be rounded to the nearest of those values.
  Assuming *value* remains constant, the same output will repeat every
  PWM cycle. If *dither-pwm* is true, the output duty cycle will be
  dithered between the two closest values, so that the long-term average
  is closer to the desired level. *dither-pwm* has no effect if
  *pwm-freq* is zero (PDM mode), since PDM is an inherently dithered process.
