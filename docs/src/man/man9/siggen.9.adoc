== NAME

siggen - signal generator

== SYNOPSIS

**loadrt siggen **[**num_chan=**_num_* | **names=**_name1_[,_name2_...]]

== DESCRIPTION

*siggen* is a signal generator that can be used for testing and other
applications that need simple waveforms. It produces sine, cosine,
triangle, sawtooth, and square waves of variable frequency, amplitude,
and offset, which can be used as inputs to other HAL components.

*siggen* supports a maximum of sixteen channels. The number of channels
actually loaded is set by the *num_chan* argument when the module is
loaded. Alternatively, specify *names=* and unique names separated by
commas.

The *num_chan=* and *names=* specifiers are mutually exclusive. If
neither *num_chan=* nor *names=* are specified, the default value is
one.

== NAMING

The names for pins, parameters, and functions are prefixed as:

**siggen.**_N_**.** for _N_ = 0, 1, ..., _num_-1 when using *num_chan=_num_*

**name**_N_. for name__N__ = name1, name2, ... when using *names=name1,name2,...*

The **siggen.**_N_**.** format is shown in the following descriptions.

== FUNCTIONS

**siggen.**_N_**.update** (uses floating-point)::
  Updates output pins for signal generator _N_. Each time it is called
  it calculates a new sample. It should be called many times faster than
  the desired signal frequency, to avoid distortion and aliasing.

== PINS

**siggen.**_N_**.frequency** float in::
  The output frequency for signal generator _N_, in Hertz.
  The default value is 1.0 Hertz.
**siggen.**_N_**.amplitude** float in::
  The output amplitude for signal generator _N_.
  If *offset* is zero, the outputs will swing from -*amplitude* to +**amplitude**.
  The default value is 1.00.
**siggen.**_N_**.offset** float in::
  The output offset for signal generator _N_.
  This value is added directly to the output signal. The default value is zero.
**siggen.**_N_**.reset** bit in::
  Resets output pins to predetermined states: +
  *sine*: 0 +
  *sawtooth*: 0 +
  *square*: -1 * amplitude +
  *cosine*: -1 * amplitude +
  *triangle*: -1 * amplitude
**siggen.**_N_**.clock** bit out::
  The clock output. Bit type clock signal output at the commanded frequency.
**siggen.**_N_**.square** float out::
  The square wave output. Positive while *triangle* and *cosine* are
  ramping upwards, and while *sine* is negative.
**siggen.**_N_**.sine** float out::
  The sine output. Lags *cosine* by 90 degrees.
**siggen.**_N_**.cosine** float out::
  The cosine output. Leads *sine* by 90 degrees.
**siggen.**_N_**.triangle** float out::
  The triangle wave output.
  Ramps up while *square* is positive, and down while *square* is negative.
  Reaches its positive and negative peaks at the same time as *cosine*.
**siggen.**_N_**.sawtooth** float out::
  The sawtooth output. Ramps upwards to its positive peak, then
  instantly drops to its negative peak and starts ramping again.
  The drop occurs when *triangle* and *cosine* are at their positive peaks,
  and coincides with the falling edge of *square*.
