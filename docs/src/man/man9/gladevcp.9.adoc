== NAME

gladevcp - displays Virtual control Panels built with GTK / GLADE

== SYNOPSIS

*loadusr gladevcp* [**-c componentname0x**_N_] [**-g WxH+Xoffset+Yoffset0x**_N_] [**-H** _halcmdfile_] [*-x* _windowid_] *gladefile.glade*

== DESCRIPTION

GladeVCP parses a glade file and displays the widgets in a window.
Then calls gladevcp_makepins which again parses the gladefile looking for
specific HAL widgets then makes HAL pins and sets up updating for them.
The HAL component name defaults to the basename of the glade file. The
-x option directs GladeVCP to reparent itself under this X window id
instead of creating its own toplevel window. The -H option passes an
input file for halcmd to be run after the GladeVCP component is
initialized. This is used in Axis when running GladeVCP under a tab with
the EMBED_TAB_NAME/EMBED_TAB_COMMAND INI file feature.

GladeVCP supports GtkBuilder or libglade files though some widgets are
not fully supported in GtkBuilder yet.

== ISSUES

For now, system links need to be added in the glade library folders to
point to our new widgets and catalog files. Look in
lib/python/gladevcp/READ_ME for details.
