== DESCRIPTION

Rather than exporting HAL pins and functions, these components provide
the forward and inverse kinematics definitions for LinuxCNC.

=== trivkins - generalized trivial kinematics

Joint numbers are assigned sequentially according to the axis letters
specified with the *coordinates=* parameter.

If the coordinates= parameter is omitted, joint numbers are assigned
*sequentially* to every known axis letter ("xyzabcuvw").

Example: loadrt *trivkins*::
Assigns all axis letters to joint numbers in sequence:::

x==joint0, y==joint1, z==joint2 a==joint3, b==joint4, c==joint5
u==joint6, v==joint7, w==joint8

 +

Example: loadrt *trivkins coordinates=xyz*::
   +

Assigns: x==joint0, y==joint1, z==joint2::
   +

Example: loadrt *trivkins coordinates=xz*::
   +

Assigns: x==joint0, z==joint1::
   +

Example: loadrt *trivkins coordinates=xyzy*::
   +

Assigns: x==joint0, y0==joint1, z==joint2, y1==joint3::

The default kinematics type is *KINEMATICS_IDENTITY*. GUIs may provide
special features for configurations using this default kinematics type.
For instance, the AXIS GUI automatically handles joint and world mode
operations so that the distinctions between joints and axes are not
visible to the operator. This is feasible since there is an exact
correspondence between a joint number and its matching axis letter.

 +

The kinematics type can be set with the *kinstype=* parameter:::
   +

kinstype=**1** for KINEMATICS_IDENTITY (default if kinstype= omitted)::
   +

kinstype=[**b**|**B**] for KINEMATICS_BOTH::
   +

kinstype=[**f**|**F**] for KINEMATICS_FORWARD_ONLY::
   +

kinstype=[**i**|**I**] for KINEMATICS_INVERSE_ONLY::
Example: loadrt *trivkins coordinates=xyz kinstype=b*::

Use kinstype=**B** (KINEMATICS_BOTH) for configurations that need to
move joints independently (joint mode) or as coordinated (teleop)
movements in world coordinates.

When using the axis gui with KINEMATICS_BOTH, the '*$*' key is used to
toggle between joint and teleop (world) modes.

An axis letter may be used more than once (*duplicated*) to assign
multiple joints to a single axis coordinate letter.

 +

Example: coordinates=**xyyzw** kinstype=**B**::
   +

Assigns: x==joint0, y==joint1 *AND* joint2, z==joint3, w==joint4::

The above example illustrates a gantry configuration that uses
*duplicated* coordinate letters to indicate that two joints (joint1 and
joint2) move a single axis (y). Using kinstype=**B** allows the
configuration to be toggled between joint and world modes of operation.
Homing configuration options are available to synchronize the final
homing move for selected joints -- see the documentation for *Homing
Configuration*.

*NOTES* for *duplicated* coordinates:

When *duplicated* coordinate letters are used, specifying
KINEMATICS_BOTH (kinstype=**B**) allows a gui to support jogging of each
individual joint in *joint mode*. *Caution* is required for machines
where the movement of a single joint (in a set specified by a
*duplicated* coordinate letter) can lead to gantry racking or other
unwanted outcomes. When the kinstype= parameter is omitted, operation
defaults to KINEMATICS_IDENTITY (kinstype=**1**) and a gui may allow
jogging based upon a selected axis coordinate letter (or by a keyboard
key) before homing is completed and the machine is still in *joint
mode*. The joint selected will depend upon the gui implementation but
typically only one of the multiple joints in the set will jog.
Consequently, specifying KINEMATICS_BOTH is recommended as it enables
support for unambiguous, independent jogging of each individual joint.
Machines that implement homing for all joints (including the provisions
for synchronizing the final homing move for multiple joints) may be
homed at machine startup and automatically switch to *world* mode where
per-coordinate jogging is available.

The kinematics use Denavit-Hartenberg definition for the joint and links.
The DH definitions are the ones used by John J Craig in
"Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control" The parameters for the
manipulator are defined by HAL pins. Note that this uses a convention
sometimes known as "Modified DH Parameters" and this must be borne in
mind when setting up the system. https://w.wiki/NcY

  joints 2 and 3 axis) and the tooltip. Zero means the tooltip is on the
  centerline. Non-zero values should be positive, if negative they

predefined locations (the motors), giving three degrees of freedom in
position (XYZ)

=== xyzac-trt-kins - 5 Axis mill (Table Rotary/Tilting)

Tilting table (A) and horizontal rotary mounted to table (C axis) (5
Joints 0:x,1:y,2:z,3:a,4:c) with provisions to switch between xyzac and
trivkins kinematic types. The joint mapping can be altered with the
coordinates parameter in the same way as supported by trivkins. (See
switchkins documentation for more info)

=== xyzbc-trt-kins - 5 Axis mill (Table Rotary/Tilting)

(5 Joints 0:x,1:y,2:z,3:b,4:c) with provisions to switch between xyzbc
and trivkins kinematic types. The joint mapping can be altered with the
coordinates parameter in the same way as supported by trivkins. (See
switchkins documentation for more info)

=== 5axiskins - 5 Axis bridge mill

XYZBCW -- the W coordinate values (typically used for tool motion) are
incorporated into XYZ positioning. (Only 5 joints are needed by the
kinematics module but an additional joint is needed to display W
values). (See switchkins documentation for more info)

By default, 5axiskins uses coordinates XYZBCW assigned consecutively to
joints 0..5. The module coordinates parameter may be used to assign
multiple joints to an axis letter and/or to assign joints to additional
coordinates A,U,V with a one-to-one correspondence to the assigned
joints. Example: XYZBCWYV (8 joints total numbered 0..7) uses two joints
for Y (joints 1,6) and adds an additional coordinate V that has a
one-to-one relation to joint 7.

Note: These kinematics may be used with the vismach 5axisgui providing
that the joint-letter assignments agree with the default ordering
expected by it (XYZBCW -> joints 0..5)
