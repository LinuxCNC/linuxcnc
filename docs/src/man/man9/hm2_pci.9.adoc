== DESCRIPTION

hm2_pci is a device driver that interfaces Mesa's PCI and PC-104/Plus
based Anything I/O boards (with the HostMot2 firmware) to the LinuxCNC HAL.

The supported boards are: the 5i20, 5i21, 5i22, 5i23, 5i24, and 5i25
(all on PCI); the 4i65, 4i68, and 4i69 (on PC-104/Plus), and the 3x20
(using a 6i68 or 7i68 carrier card) and 6i25 (on PCI Express).

The driver optionally programs the board's FPGA with firmware when it
registers the board with the hostmot2 driver. The firmware to load is
specified in the *config* modparam, as described in the hostmot2(9)
manpage, in the _config modparam_ section.
