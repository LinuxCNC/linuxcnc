== NAME

lineardeltakins - Kinematics for a linear delta robot

== SYNOPSIS

*loadrt lineardeltakins*

== KINEMATICS

The kinematics model is appropriate for a rostock/kossel-style design
with three joints arranged in an equilateral triangle. (0,0) is always
the center of the working volume. Joint 0 is at (0,R) and subsequent
joints are 120 degrees clockwise (note that joint 0 is not at zero
radians). The length of the arm is _L_.

Joints 0-2 are the linear carriages. Axes ABC and UVW are passed through
unchanged in joints 3-8, so that e.g., A can still be used to control an
extruder.

== PINS

*lineardeltakins.R* float in::
  Effective diameter of the platform.

The radius R is different than the distance from the center of the table to the
center of the belt/smooth rod/extrusion that the joints ride on. In
RepRap delta parlance, R is DELTA_RADIUS which is computed as

DELTA_SMOOTH_ROD_OFFSET - DELTA_EFFECTOR_OFFSET - DELTA_CARRIAGE_OFFSET.

*lineardeltakins.L* float in::
  Length of the rod connecting the carriage to the effector. In RepRap
  delta parlance, L is DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD.

== NOTES

The R and L values can be adjusted while LinuxCNC is running. However,
doing so while in coordinated mode will lead to a step change in joint
position, which generally will trigger a following error if in joint
mode with machine on.
