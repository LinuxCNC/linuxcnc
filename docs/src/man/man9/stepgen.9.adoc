== NAME

stepgen - software step pulse generation

== SYNOPSIS

**loadrt stepgen step_type=**_type0_[,_type1_...] [**ctrl_type=**_type0_[,_type1_...]] [**user_step_type=#,#**...]

== DESCRIPTION

*stepgen* is used to control stepper motors. The maximum step rate
depends on the CPU and other factors, and is usually in the range of 5
kHz to 25 kHz. If higher rates are needed, a hardware step generator is
a better choice.

*stepgen* has two control modes, which can be selected on a channel by
channel basis using *ctrl_type*. Possible values are "*p*" for position
control, and "*v*" for velocity control. The default is position
control, which drives the motor to a commanded position, subject to
acceleration and velocity limits. Velocity control drives the motor at a
commanded speed, again subject to accel and velocity limits. Usually,
position mode is used for machine axes. Velocity mode is reserved for
unusual applications where continuous movement at some speed is desired,
instead of movement to a specific position. (Note that velocity mode
replaces the former component *freqgen*.)

*stepgen* can control a maximum of 16 motors. The number of
motors/channels actually loaded depends on the number of _type_ values
given. The value of each _type_ determines the outputs for that channel.
Position or velocity mode can be individually selected for each channel.
Both control modes support the same 16 possible step types.

By far the most common step type is '0', standard step and direction.
Others include up/down, quadrature, and a wide variety of three, four,
and five phase patterns that can be used to directly control some types
of motor windings. (When used with appropriate buffers of course.)

Some of the stepping types are described below, but for more details
(including timing diagrams) see the *stepgen* section of the HAL
reference manual.

type 0: step/dir::
  Two pins, one for step and one for direction. *make-pulses* must run
  at least twice for each step (once to set the step pin true, once to
  clear it). This limits the maximum step rate to half (or less) of the
  rate that can be reached by types 2-14. The parameters *steplen* and
  *stepspace* can further lower the maximum step rate. Parameters
  *dirsetup* and *dirhold* also apply to this step type.
type 1: up/down::
  Two pins, one for 'step up' and one for 'step down'. Like type 0,
  *make-pulses* must run twice per step, which limits the maximum speed.
type 2: quadrature::
  Two pins, phase-A and phase-B. For forward motion, A leads B. Can
  advance by one step every time *make-pulses* runs.
type 3: three phase, full step::
  Three pins, phase-A, phase-B, and phase-C. Three steps per full cycle,
  then repeats. Only one phase is high at a time - for forward motion
  the pattern is A, then B, then C, then A again.
type 4: three phase, half step::
  Three pins, phases A through C. Six steps per full cycle. First A is
  high alone, then A and B together, then B alone, then B and C
  together, etc.
types 5 through 8: four phase, full step::
  Four pins, phases A through D. Four steps per full cycle. Types 5 and
  6 are suitable for use with unipolar steppers, where power is applied
  to the center tap of each winding, and four open-collector transistors
  drive the ends. Types 7 and 8 are suitable for bipolar steppers,
  driven by two H-bridges.
types 9 and 10: four phase, half step::
  Four pins, phases A through D. Eight steps per full cycle. Type 9 is
  suitable for unipolar drive, and type 10 for bipolar drive.
types 11 and 12: five phase, full step::
  Five pins, phases A through E. Five steps per full cycle. See HAL
  reference manual for the patterns.
types 13 and 14: five phase, half step::
  Five pins, phases A through E. Ten steps per full cycle. See HAL
  reference manual for the patterns.
type 15: user-specified::
  This uses the waveform specified by the *user_step_type* module
  parameter, which may have up to 10 steps and 5 phases.

== FUNCTIONS

*stepgen.make-pulses* (no floating-point)::
  Generates the step pulses, using information computed by *update-freq*.
  Must be called as frequently as possible, to maximize the attainable step rate and minimize jitter.
  Operates on all channels at once.
*stepgen.capture-position* (uses floating point)::
  Captures position feedback value from the high speed code and makes it available on a pin for use elsewhere in the system.
  Operates on all channels at once.
*stepgen.update-freq* (uses floating point)::
  Accepts a velocity or position command and converts it into a form usable by *make-pulses* for step generation.
  Operates on all channels at once.

== PINS

**stepgen.**__N__**.counts** s32 out::
  The current position, in counts, for channel _N_. Updated by *capture-position*.
**stepgen.**__N__**.position-fb** float out::
  The current position, in length units (see parameter *position-scale*).
  Updated by *capture-position*. The resolution of *position-fb* is much finer than a single step.
  If you need to see individual steps, use *counts*.
**stepgen.**__N__**.enable** bit in::
  Enables output steps - when false, no steps are generated.
**stepgen.**__N__**.velocity-cmd** float in (velocity mode only)::
  Commanded velocity, in length units per second (see parameter
  *position-scale*).
**stepgen.**__N__**.position-cmd** float in (position mode only)::
  Commanded position, in length units (see parameter *position-scale)*.
**stepgen.**__N__**.step** bit out (step type 0 only)::
  Step pulse output.
**stepgen.**__N__**.dir** bit out (step type 0 only)::
  Direction output: low for forward, high for reverse.
**stepgen.**__N__**.up** bit out (step type 1 only)::
  Count up output, pulses for forward steps.
**stepgen.**__N__**.down** bit out (step type 1 only)::
  Count down output, pulses for reverse steps.
**stepgen.**__N__**.phase-A** thru *phase-E* bit out (step types 2-14 only)::
  Output bits. `phase-A` and `phase-B` are present for step types 2-14,
  `phase-C` for types 3-14, `phase-D` for types 5-14, and `phase-E` for types 11-14.
  Behavior depends on selected stepping type.

== PARAMETERS

**stepgen.**_N_**.frequency** float ro::
  The current step rate, in steps per second, for channel _N_.
**stepgen.**_N_**.maxaccel** float rw::
  The acceleration/deceleration limit, in length units per second squared.
**stepgen.**_N_**.maxvel** float rw::
  The maximum allowable velocity, in length units per second.
  If the requested maximum velocity cannot be reached with the current
  combination of scaling and *make-pulses* thread period, it will be
  reset to the highest attainable value.
**stepgen.**_N_**.position-scale** float rw::
  The scaling for position feedback, position command, and velocity
  command, in steps per length unit.
**stepgen.**_N_**.rawcounts** s32 ro::
  The position in counts, as updated by *make-pulses*.
  (Note: this is updated more frequently than the *counts* pin.)
**stepgen.**_N_**.steplen** u32 rw::
  The length of the step pulses, in nanoseconds.
  Measured from rising edge to falling edge.
**stepgen.**_N_**.stepspace** u32 rw (step types 0 and 1 only)::
  The minimum space between step pulses, in nanoseconds. Measured from
  falling edge to rising edge. The actual time depends on the step rate
  and can be much longer. If *stepspace* is 0, then *step* can be
  asserted every period. This can be used in conjunction with
  *hal_parport*'s auto-resetting pins to output one step pulse per
  period. In this mode, *steplen* must be set for one period or less.
**stepgen.**_N_**.dirsetup** u32 rw (step type 0 only)::
  The minimum setup time from direction to step, in nanoseconds periods.
  Measured from change of direction to rising edge of step.
**stepgen.**_N_**.dirhold** u32 rw (step type 0 only)::
  The minimum hold time of direction after step, in nanoseconds.
  Measured from falling edge of step to change of direction.
**stepgen.**_N_**.dirdelay** u32 rw (step types 1 and higher only)::
  The minimum time between a forward step and a reverse step, in nanoseconds.

== TIMING

There are five timing parameters which control the output waveform.
No step type uses all five, and only those which will be used are exported to HAL.
The values of these parameters are in nano-seconds,
so no recalculation is needed when changing thread periods.
In the timing diagrams that follow, they are identified by the following numbers:

{empty}(1) *stepgen.n.steplen*

{empty}(2) *stepgen.n.stepspace*

{empty}(3) *stepgen.n.dirhold*

{empty}(4) *stepgen.n.dirsetup*

{empty}(5) *stepgen.n.dirdelay*

For step type 0, timing parameters 1 thru 4 are used. The following
timing diagram shows the output waveforms, and what each parameter adjusts.

For step type 1, timing parameters 1, 2, and 5 are used. The following
timing diagram shows the output waveforms, and what each parameter adjusts.

For step types 2 and higher, the exact pattern of the outputs depends on
the step type (see the HAL manual for a full listing). The outputs
change from one state to another at a minimum interval of *steplen*.
When a direction change occurs, the minimum time between the last step
in one direction and the first in the other direction is the sum of
*steplen* and *dirdelay*.
