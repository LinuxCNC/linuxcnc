The limits for the following items are compile-time settings:

*num_joints*:: Maximum number of joints is set by *EMCMOT_MAX_JOINTS*.

  This parameter is mutually exclusive with *num_dio*, but can be combined with *names_din*.
  A maximum of *EMCMOT_MAX_DIO* names can be specified.
  The default digital output pin has names like *motion.digital-out-00* whereas *names_dout=*_is-homing-x,is-homing-y_
  will create the HAL pins `motion.dout-is-homing-x` and `motion.dout-is-homing-y`.

  This parameter is mutually exclusive with *num_dio*, but can be
  combined with *names_dout*. A maximum of *EMCMOT_MAX_DIO* names can be
  specified. The default digital input pin has names like
  *motion.digital-in-00* whereas *names_din=*_homed-x,homed-y_ will
  create the HAL pins `motion.din-homed-x` and `motion.din-homed-y`.

*num_aio*:: Maximum number of analog IO pins is set by
*EMCMOT_MAX_AIO*.
  Minimum is 1, if *num_aio* is not specified, it defaults to *DEFAULT_AIO*.

*names_aout*:: A comma-separated list of names for analog output pins.
  This parameter is mutually exclusive with *num_aio*, but can be
  combined with *names_ain*. A maximum of *EMCMOT_MAX_AIO* names can be
  specified. The default analog output pin has names like
  *motion.analog-out-00* whereas *names_aout=*_feedrate1,feedrate2_ will
  create the HAL pins `motion.aout-feedrate1` and `motion.aout-feedrate2`.

*names_ain*:: A comma-separated list of names for analog input pins.
  This parameter is mutually exclusive with *num_aio*, but can be
  combined with *names_aout*. A maximum of *EMCMOT_MAX_AIO* names can be
  specified. The default analog input pin has names like
  *motion.analog-in-00* whereas *names_ain=*_proxy1,proxy2_ will create
  the HAL pins `motion.ain-proxy1` and `motion.ain-proxy2`.

*num_misc_error*:: Maximum number of extra error inputs is set by *EMCMOT_MAX_MISC_ERRORS*.

*names_misc_errors*:: A comma-separated list of names for extra error inputs.
  This parameter is mutually exclusive with num_misc_error.
  If using num_misc_error the additional error input pins will have names

  will create hal pins `motion.err-overtemp` and `motion.err-undertemp`.

*num_spindles*:: Maximum number of spindles is set by *EMCMOT_MAX_SPINDLES*.

Pin names starting with "*joint*" or "*axis*" are read and updated by
the motion-controller function.

== DESCRIPTION

By default, the base thread does not support floating point. Software
stepping, software encoder counting, and software pwm do not use floating point.
*base_thread_fp* can be used to enable floating point in
the base thread (for example for brushless DC motor control).

These pins and parameters are created by the realtime *motmod* module.
This module provides a HAL interface for LinuxCNC's motion planner.
Basically *motmod* takes in a list of waypoints and generates a nice
blended and constraint-limited stream of joint positions to be fed to
the motor drives.

The optional *num_extrajoints* parameter specifies a quantity of joints
that participate in homing but are not used by kinematics
transformations. After homing, control of an 'extra' joint is
transferred to a posthome command HAL pin (joint.N.posthome-cmd) and the
motor feedback value is ignored. 'Extra' joints must be managed by
independent motion planners/controllers (typically using limit3 HAL
components). Extra joints maybe unhomed only when motion is disabled.

The maximum *num_extrajoints* value is equal to the *num_joints* value.
(Note that using the maximum value would allow no operation in world
coordinates). The *num_joints* value must be equal to the sum of the
number of joints used for kinematics calculations plus the number of
'extra' joints.

The *num_joints* parameter is conventionally set using the INI file
setting **[KINS]JOINTS=**value. The *num_extrajoints* is set by the
additional motmod parameter **[EMCMOT]motmod num_extrajoints=**value.
HAL pin numbering for all joints is zero based [*0 ... num_joints-1*].
When specified, 'extra' joints are assigned the last *num_extrajoints*
in the numbering sequence. For example, specifying [KINS]JOINTS=5 and
[EMCMOT]motmod num_extrajoints=2 for a 3 joint trivkins configuration
*[KINS] KINEMATICS=trivkins coordinates=xyz* uses joints 0,1,2 for the
kinematic joints and joints 3,4 for the 'extra' joints.

An equal number of digital or analog IO pins will always be created. For
example, if *names_din* is specified with two pins, two named input and
two default named output pins will be created. In cases where
*names_dout* is specified with two pins and *names_din* with three pins,
two named output and one default named output pin will be created, along
with three named input pins. This principle applies independently to
digital and analog IO pins, allowing for scenarios such as having three
digital pins and two analog pins.

machine, the tool, or the work piece).

If the machine is in the middle of a (non-spindle synchronized) move
when this pin goes TRUE, the machine will decelerate to a stop at the
maximum allowed acceleration rate.

Motion resumes when this pin goes FALSE.

Note: feed-inhibit applies to G-code commands -- not jogs.

*motion.feed-upm* OUT FLOAT::
  Current feed rate in G-code program units per minute for
  motion.motion-type feed(2) and arc(3). Value is the G-code program F

  units used.
*motion.feed-inches-per-minute* OUT FLOAT::

  is disallowed and an error is reported.
  By default, homing is allowed in joint mode whenever motion is enabled.

*motion.jog-stop-immediate* IN BIT::
  If any jog is active when the pin state changes to TRUE then that jog
  will be stopped immediately.
*motion.jog-is-active* OUT BIT::
  TRUE if any joint or axis is jogging.
*motion.in-position* OUT BIT::
  TRUE if the machine is in position (i.e., not currently moving towards the commanded position).
**motion.misc-error-**_NN_ IN BIT::
  Extra error inputs for faults such as over-temperature sensors,
  low coolant warnings, custom HAL component errors.
  If driven TRUE this will disable a machine. Similar to spindle.amp-fault-in.
