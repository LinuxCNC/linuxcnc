= watchdog(9)

== NAME

watchdog - monitor multiple inputs for a "heartbeat"

== SYNOPSIS

*loadrt watchdog num_inputs=*__N__

You must specify the number of inputs, from 1 to 32.
Each input has a separate timeout value.

== FUNCTIONS

*process*::
  Check all input pins for transitions, clear the *ok-out* pin if any
  input has no transition within its timeout period. This function does
  not use floating point, and should be added to a fast thread.
*set-timeouts*::
  Check for timeout changes, and convert the float timeout inputs to int values
  that can be used in *process*. This function also monitors `enable-in`
  for false to true transitions, and re-enables monitoring when such a transition is detected.
  This function does use floating point, and it is appropriate to add it to the servo thread.

== PINS

**watchdog.input-**__N__ bit in::
  Input number _N_. The inputs are numbered from 0 to *num_inputs*-1.
**watchdog.enable-in** bit in (default: FALSE)::
  If TRUE, forces out-ok to be false. Additionally, if a timeout occurs
  on any input, this pin must be set FALSE and TRUE again to re-start
  the monitoring of input pins.
*watchdog.ok-out* bit out (default: FALSE)::
  OK output. This pin is true only if enable-in is TRUE and no timeout
  has been detected. This output can be connected to the enable input of
  a *charge_pump* or *stepgen* (in v mode), to provide a heartbeat
  signal to external monitoring hardware.

== PARAMETERS

**watchdog.timeout-**_N_ float in::
  Timeout value for input number _N_.
  The inputs are numbered from 0 to **num_inputs**-1.
  The timeout is in seconds, and may not be below zero.
  Note that a timeout of 0.0 will likely prevent *ok-out* from ever becoming true.
  Also note that excessively long timeouts are relatively useless for monitoring purposes.
