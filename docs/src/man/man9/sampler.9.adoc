= sampler(9)

== NAME

sampler - sample data from HAL in real time

== SYNOPSIS

*loadrt sampler* **depth=**_depth1_[,_depth2_...] **cfg=**_string1_[,_string2_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*sampler* and **halsampler**(1) are used together to sample HAL data in
real time and store it in a file. *sampler* is a realtime HAL component
that exports HAL pins and creates a FIFO in shared memory. It then
begins sampling data from the HAL and storing it to the FIFO.
*halsampler* is a non-realtime program that copies data from the FIFO to
stdout, where it can be redirected to a file or piped to some other
program.

== OPTIONS

*depth=*_depth1_[,_depth2_...]::
  sets the depth of the realtime->non-realtime FIFO that *sampler*
  creates to buffer the realtime data. Multiple values of _depth_
  (separated by commas) can be specified if you need more than one FIFO
  (for example if you want to sample data from two different realtime
  threads).
*cfg=*_string1_[,_string2_...]::
  defines the set of HAL pins that *sampler* exports and later samples
  data from. One _string_ must be supplied for each FIFO, separated by
  commas. *sampler* exports one pin for each character in _string._
  Legal characters are:

::
  *F, f* (float pin)
::
  *B, b* (bit pin)
::
  *S, s* (s32 pin)
::
  *U, u* (u32 pin)

== FUNCTIONS

*sampler.*_N_::
  One function is created per FIFO, numbered from zero.

== PINS

*sampler.*_N_*.pin.*_M_ input::
  Pin for the data that will wind up in column _M_ of FIFO _N_ (and in
  column _M_ of the output file). The pin type depends on the config
  string.
*sampler.*_N_*.curr-depth* s32 output::
  Current number of samples in the FIFO. When this reaches _depth_ new
  data will begin overwriting old data, and some samples will be lost.
*sampler.*_N_*.full* bit output::
  TRUE when the FIFO _N_ is full, FALSE when there is room for another
  sample.
*sampler.*_N_*.enable* bit input::
  When TRUE, samples are captured and placed in FIFO _N_, when FALSE, no
  samples are acquired. Defaults to TRUE.

== PARAMETERS

**sampler.**_N_**.overruns** s32 read/write::
  The number of times that *sampler* has tried to write data to the HAL
  pins but found no room in the FIFO. It increments whenever *full* is
  true, and can be reset by the *setp* command.
**sampler.**_N_**.sample-num** s32 read/write::
  A number that identifies the sample. It is automatically incremented
  for each sample, and can be reset using the *setp* command. The sample
  number can optionally be printed in the first column of the output
  from *halsampler*, using the _-t_ option (see *man 1 halsampler* ).
