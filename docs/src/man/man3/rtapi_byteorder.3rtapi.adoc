== NAME

rtapi_byteorder - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

....
#include <rtapi_byteorder.h>
....

RTAPI_BIG_ENDIAN::
  Defined to 1 if the platform is big-endian, 0 otherwise
RTAPI_LITTLE_ENDIAN::
  Defined to 1 if the platform is little-endian, 0 otherwise
RTAPI_FLOAT_BIG_ENDIAN::
  Defined to 1 if the platform double-precision value is big-endian, 0
  otherwise.

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI_XXX identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not
provided by a kernel, generally another implementation--possibly with
reduced functionality--is provided. (For example, the userspace
implementation for rtapi_byteorder_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be used at any time.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
