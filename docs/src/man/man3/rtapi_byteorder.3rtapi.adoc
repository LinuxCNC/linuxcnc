== NAME

rtapi_byteorder - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_byteorder.h>
----

RTAPI_BIG_ENDIAN::
  Defined to 1 if the platform is big-endian, 0 otherwise.
RTAPI_LITTLE_ENDIAN::
  Defined to 1 if the platform is little-endian, 0 otherwise.
RTAPI_FLOAT_BIG_ENDIAN::
  Defined to 1 if the platform double-precision value is big-endian, 0 otherwise.

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI_XXX identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not provided by a kernel,
generally another implementation--possibly with reduced functionality--is provided.
(For example, the userspace implementation for rtapi_byteorder_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be used at any time.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
