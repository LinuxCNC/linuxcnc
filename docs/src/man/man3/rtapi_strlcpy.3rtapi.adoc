== NAME

rtapi_strlcpy - RTAPI string manipulation functions

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_string.h>

size_t rtapi_strlcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t sz);
#define rtapi_strxcpy(dst, src) ...
size_t rtapi_strlcat(char *dst, const char *src, size_t sz);
#define rtapi_strxcat(dst, src) ...
----

== DESCRIPTION

rtapi_strlcpy will copy at most 'sz' chars from 'src' to 'dst'.
Always leaves 'dst' NUL-terminated except if 'sz' is 0.

rtapi_strxcpy(dst, src) checks that 'dst' is an array with known size,
and calls rtapi_strlcpy(dst, src, sizeof(dst)). If it is not an array
with a known size, it is a (possibly cryptic!) syntax error.

rtapi_strlcat will append characters from 'src' to 'dst', stopping when
the end of 'src' is reached, or 'dst' uses 'sz'-many bytes of storage
including the tailing null.

rtapi_strxcat(dst, src) checks that 'dst' is an array with known size,
and calls rtapi_strlcat(dst, src, sizeof(dst)). If it is not an array
with a known size, it is a (possibly cryptic!) syntax error.

== RETURN VALUE

The total length of the string strlcpy or strlcat tried to create.
For strlcpy() that means the length of 'src'.
If the return value is greater than or equal to 'sz', the result was truncated.
