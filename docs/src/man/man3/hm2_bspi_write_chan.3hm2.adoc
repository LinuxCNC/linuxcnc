== NAME

hm2_bspi_write_chan - write data to a Hostmot2 Buffered SPI channel

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
hm2_bspi_write_chan(char* name, int chan, u32 val)
----

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_bspi_write_chan* write one-time data to the bspi channel "chan" on
the bspi instance "name". "name" is a unique string given to each bspi
channel during hostmot2 setup. The names of the available channels are
printed to standard output during the driver loading process and take
the form: hm2___<board name>__.__<board index>__.bspi.__<index>__.
For example: `hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0`.

This function performs a one-time write of data to the specified channel.
It is typically used for setup and chip enabling purposes.
It should not be used in the main loop for regular data transfers
(but is appropriate to use for on-the-fly setup changes).

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from init/cleanup code and from within realtime tasks.
Not available in non-realtime components.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
