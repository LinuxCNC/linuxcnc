== NAME

rtapi_outb, rtapi_inb - Perform hardware I/O

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
void rtapi_outb(unsigned char _byte_, unsigned int _port_);
unsigned char rtapi_inb(unsigned int _port_);
----

== ARGUMENTS

port::
  The address of the I/O port
byte::
  The byte to be written to the port

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_outb* writes a byte to a hardware I/O port. *rtapi_inb* reads a byte from a hardware I/O port.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from init/cleanup code and from within realtime tasks.
Not available in non-realtime components.

== RETURN VALUE

*rtapi_inb* returns the byte read from the given I/O port

== NOTES

The I/O address should be within a region previously allocated by *rtapi_request_region*.
Otherwise, another real-time module or the Linux kernel might attempt to access the I/O region at the same time.
