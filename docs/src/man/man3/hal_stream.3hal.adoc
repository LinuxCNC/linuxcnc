== DESCRIPTION

A HAL stream provides a limited ability for two components to
communicate data which does not fit within the model of HAL pins.
A reader and a writer must agree on a _key_ (32-bit integer identifier)
and a data structure specified by _typestring_.
They must also agree which component (the first one loaded) will *hal_stream_create* the stream,
and which component (the second one loaded) will *hal_stream_attach* to the already-created stream.

The non-realtime part can be *halstreamer* or *halsampler*.
In the case of *halstreamer* the key is 0x48535430 plus the channel number.
In the case of *halsampler* the key is 0x48534130 plus the channel number.

*hal_stream_create*::
  Create the given stream, initializing the _stream_ which is passed by reference.
  It is an undiagnosed error if a stream has already been created with the same _key_.

*hal_stream_destroy*::
  Destroy the given stream. It is an undiagnosed error if the stream is
  still attached by another component. It is an undiagnosed error if the
  stream was attached with *hal_stream_attach* rather than created with
  *hal_stream_create*. It is an undiagnosed error if the call to
  *hal_stream_destroy* is omitted.

*hal_stream_attach*::
  Attach the given stream, which was already created by *hal_stream_create*.
  If the typestring is specified, this call fails if it does not match the typestring the stream was created with.
  If the typestring argument is NULL, then any typestring is accepted.

*hal_stream_detach*::
  Detach the given stream. It is an undiagnosed error if the stream was
  created with *hal_stream_create* rather than attached with *hal_stream_attach*.
  It is an undiagnosed error if the call to *hal_stream_detach* is omitted.

*hal_stream_element_count*:: Returns the number of pins.

*hal_stream_element_type*:: Returns the type of the given pin number.

*hal_stream_readable*:: Returns true if the stream has at least one sample to read

*hal_stream_read*:: If the stream has one sample to read, stores it in buf.

*hal_stream_writable*:: Returns true if the stream has room for at least one sample to be written.

*hal_stream_depth*:: Returns the number of samples waiting to be read.

*hal_stream_maxdepth*:: Returns the *depth* argument that the stream was created with.

*hal_stream_num_overruns*:: Returns a number which is incremented each time *hal_stream_write* is called without space available.

*hal_stream_num_underruns*:: Returns a number which is incremented each time *hal_stream_read* is called without a sample available.

*hal_stream_wait_readable*:: Waits until the stream is readable or the stop flag is set.

*hal_stream_wait_writable*:: Waits until the stream is writable or the stop flag is set.

*hal_stream_read*:: Reads a record from stream.
  If successful, it is stored in the given buffer.
  Optionally, the sample number can be retrieved. If no sample is available, _num_underruns_ is incremented.
  It is an undetected error if more than one component or real-time function calls *hal_stream_read* concurrently.

*hal_stream_write*:: Writes a record to the stream.
  If successful, it copied from the given buffer.
  If no room is available, _num_overruns_ is incremented.
  In either case, the internal _sampleno_ value is incremented.
  It is an undetected error if more than one component or real-time function calls *hal_stream_write* concurrently.

== ARGUMENTS

stream::
  A pointer to a stream object. In the case of *hal_stream_create* and
  *hal_stream_attach* this is an uninitialized stream; in other cases,
  it must be a stream created or attached by an earlier call and not yet
  detached or destroyed.
hal_id::
  An HAL component identifier returned by an earlier call to *hal_init*.
key::
  The key for the shared memory segment.
depth::
  The number of samples that can be unread before any samples are lost
  (overrun)
typestring::
  A typestring is a case-insensitive string which consists of one or
  more of the following type characters:
  +
  [upperalpha, start=2]
  . for bool / hal_bit_t
  . for int32_t / hal_s32_t
  . for uint32_t / hal_u32_t
  . for real_t / hal_float_t
  +
  A typestring is limited to 16 characters.

buf::
  A buffer big enough to hold all the data in one sample.
sampleno::
  If non-NULL, the last sample number is stored here. Gaps in this
  sequence indicate that an overrun occurred between the previous read
  and this one. May be NULL, in which case the sample number is not
  retrieved.
stop::
  A pointer to a value which is monitored while waiting. If it is
  nonzero, the wait operation returns early. This allows a wait call to
  be safely terminated in the case of a signal.

== SAMPLE CODE

In the source tree under `src/hal/components`, *sampler.c* and
*streamer.c* are realtime components that read and write HAL streams.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

*hal_stream_read*, *hal_stream_readable*, *hal_stream_write*,
*hal_stream_writable*, *hal_stream_element_count*, *hal_tream_pin_type*,
*hal_stream_depth*, *hal_stream_maxdepth*, *hal_stream_num_underruns*,
*hal_stream_number_overruns* may be called from realtime code.

*hal_stream_wait_writable*, *hal_stream_wait_writable* may be called from ULAPI code.

Other functions may be called in any context, including realtime contexts.

== RETURN VALUE

The functions *hal_stream_create*, *hal_stream_attach*, *hal_stream_read*,
*hal_stream_write*, *hal_stream_detach* and *hal_stream_destroy* return
an RTAPI status code. Other functions' return values are explained above.

== BUGS

The memory overhead of a stream can be large.
Each element in a record uses 8 bytes, and the implicit sample number also uses 8 bytes.
As a result, a stream which is used to transport 8-bit values uses 94% of its memory as overhead.
However, for modest stream sizes this overhead is not important.
(This memory is part of its own shared memory region and does not count against the HAL shared memory region used for pins, parameters and signals.)
