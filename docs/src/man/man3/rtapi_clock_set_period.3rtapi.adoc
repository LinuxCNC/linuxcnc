== NAME

rtapi_clock_set_period - set the basic time interval for realtime tasks

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
rtapi_clock_set_period(long int nsec);
----

== ARGUMENTS

nsec::
  The desired basic time interval for realtime tasks.

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_clock_set_period* sets the basic time interval for realtime tasks.
All periodic tasks will run at an integer multiple of this period.
The first call to *rtapi_clock_set_period* with _nsec_ greater than zero will start the clock,
using _nsec_ as the clock period in nano-seconds.
Due to hardware and RTOS limitations, the actual period may not be exactly what was requested.
On success, the function will return the actual clock period if it is available,
otherwise it returns the requested period. If the requested period is outside the limits
imposed by the hardware or RTOS, it returns *-EINVAL* and does not start
the clock. Once the clock is started, subsequent calls with non-zero
_nsec_ return *-EINVAL* and have no effect.
Calling *rtapi_clock_set_period* with _nsec_ set to zero queries the clock,
returning the current clock period, or zero if the clock has not yet been started.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from within init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.
This function is not available from non-realtime code.

== RETURN VALUE

The actual period provided by the RTOS, which may be different than the
requested period, or a RTAPI status code.
