== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_mutex.h>

int rtapi_mutex_try(unsigned long* _mutex_);
int rtapi_mutex_get(unsigned long* _mutex_);
int rtapi_mutex_give(unsigned long* _mutex_);

== ARGUMENTS

mutex::
  A pointer to the mutex.

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_mutex_try* makes a non-blocking attempt to get the mutex.
If the mutex is available, it returns 0, and the mutex is no longer available.
Otherwise, it returns a nonzero value.

*rtapi_mutex_get* blocks until the mutex is available.

*rtapi_mutex_give* releases a mutex acquired by *rtapi_mutex_try* or *rtapi_mutex_get*.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

*rtapi_mutex_give* and *rtapi_mutex_try* may be used from non-realtime, init/cleanup, and realtime code.

*rtapi_mutex_get* may not be used from realtime code.

== RETURN VALUE

*rtapi_mutex_try* returns 0 for if the mutex was claimed, and nonzero otherwise.

*rtapi_mutex_get* and *rtapi_mutex_gif* have no return value.
