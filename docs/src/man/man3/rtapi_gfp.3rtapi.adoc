== NAME

rtapi_gfp - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_gfp.h>
enum rtapi_gfp_e;
RTAPI_GFP_xxx
typedef ... rtapi_gfp_t;
----

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI_XXX identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not
provided by a kernel, generally another implementation--possibly with
reduced functionality--is provided. (For example, the userspace
implementation for rtapi_device_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Typically, these functions may be called from realtime init/cleanup code.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
