== NAME

rtapi_shmem, rtapi_shmem_new, rtapi_shmem_delete, rtapi_shmem_getptr - Functions for managing shared memory blocks

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
int rtapi_shmem_new(int _key_, int _module_id_, unsigned long int _size_);
int rtapi_shmem_delete(int _shmem_id_, int _module_id_);
int rtapi_shmem_getptr(int _shmem_id_, void ** _ptr_);
----

== ARGUMENTS

key::
  Identifies the memory block. Key must be nonzero.
  All modules wishing to use the same memory must use the same key.
module_id::
  Module identifier returned by a prior call to *rtapi_init*.
size::
  The desired size of the shared memory block, in bytes
ptr::
  The pointer to the shared memory block.
  Note that the block may be mapped at a different address for different modules.

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_shmem_new* allocates a block of shared memory. _key_ identifies
the memory block, and must be non-zero. All modules wishing to access
the same memory must use the same key. _module_id_ is the ID of the
module that is making the call (see rtapi_init). The block will be at
least _size_ bytes, and may be rounded up. Allocating many small blocks
may be very wasteful. When a particular block is allocated for the first
time, the contents are zeroed. Subsequent allocations of the same block
by other modules or processes will not touch the contents of the block.
Applications can use those bytes to see if they need to initialize the
block, or if another module already did so. On success, it returns a
positive integer ID, which is used for all subsequent calls dealing with
the block. On failure it returns a negative error code.

*rtapi_shmem_delete* frees the shared memory block associated with _shmem_id_.
_module_id_ is the ID of the calling module. Returns a status code.

*rtapi_shmem_getptr* sets _*ptr_ to point to shared memory block
associated with _shmem_id_.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

*rtapi_shmem_getptr* may be called from non-realtime code, init/cleanup code, or realtime tasks.

*rtapi_shmem_new* and *rtapi_shmem_dete* may not be called from realtime tasks.
