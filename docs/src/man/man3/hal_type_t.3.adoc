== NAME

hal_type_t, hal_bool, hal_bit_t, hal_s32_t, hal_u32_t, hal_port_t, hal_float_t, real_t, ireal_t - typedefs for HAL datatypes

== DESCRIPTION

typedef ... *hal_bool;*::
  A type which may have a value of 0 or nonzero.
typedef ... *hal_bit_t;*::
  A volatile type which may have a value of 0 or nonzero.
typedef ... *hal_s32_t*;::
  A volatile type which may have a value from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
typedef ... *hal_u32_t*;::
  A volatile type which may have a value from 0 to 4294967295.
typedef ... *hal_port_t*;::
  A volatile handle to a port object. Used with hal_port* functions.
typedef ... *hal_float_t*;::
  A volatile floating-point type, which typically has the same precision
  and range as the C type *double*.
typedef ... *real_t*;::
  A nonvolatile floating-point type with at least as much precision as
  *hal_float_t*.
typedef ... *ireal_t*;::
  A nonvolatile unsigned integral type the same size as *hal_float_t*.
typedef enum *hal_type_t*;::
  +
  *HAL_BIT*;;
    Corresponds to the type *hal_bit_t*.
  *HAL_FLOAT*;;
    Corresponds to the type *hal_float_t*.
  *HAL_S32*;;
    Corresponds to the type *hal_s32_t*.
  *HAL_U32*;;
    Corresponds to the type *hal_u32_t*.

== NOTES

*hal_bit_t* is typically a typedef to an integer type whose range is
larger than just 0 and 1. When testing the value of a *hal_bit_t*, never
compare it to 1. Prefer one of the following:

____
* if(b)
* if(b != 0)
____

It is often useful to refer to a type that can represent all the values
as a HAL type, but without the volatile qualifier. The following types
correspond with the HAL types:

hal_bit_t:: int
hal_s32_t:: __s32
hal_u32_t:: __u32
hal_float_t:: hal_real_t
hal_port_t:: int

Take care not to use the types *s32* and *u32*. These will compile in
kernel modules but not in userspace, and not for realtime components
when using uspace realtime.
