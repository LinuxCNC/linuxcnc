== DESCRIPTION

A HAL port pin is a HAL pin that acts as a one way byte oriented data
stream in real-time. An output port on any component may be connected to
an input port on any other component via a signal. Data written on the
output pin becomes accessible to the input pin. A HAL port signal may
link only a single writer and a single reader.

A port also buffers data. Users should determine the proper buffer size
based upon their intended application.

=== *hal_port_read*

Reads count bytes from the port into destination buffer dest.
hal_port_read will read _count_ bytes if and only if _count_ bytes are
available for reading and otherwise it will leave the port unaffected.
Returns true if count bytes were read and false otherwise. This function
should only be called by the component that owns the IN PORT pin.

=== *hal_port_peek*

Behaves the same as hal_port_read, however it does not consume bytes
from the HAL port. Repeated calls to hal_port_peek will return the same
data. Returns true if count bytes were read and false otherwise. This
function should only be called by the component that owns the IN PORT
pin.

=== *hal_port_peek_commit*

Advances the read position in the port buffer by count bytes.
A hal_port_peek followed by a hal_port_peek_commit would function
equivalently to hal_port_read given the same count value. Returns true
if count readable bytes were skipped and are no longer accessible and
false if no bytes wer skipped. This function should only be called by
the component that owns the IN PORT pin.

=== *hal_port_readable*

Returns the number of bytes available for reading from port. It is safe
to call this function from any component.

=== *hal_port_clear*

Emptys a given port of all data. hal_port_clear should only be called by
the component that owns the IN PORT pin.

=== *hal_port_write*

Writes count bytes from src into the port. Returns true if count bytes
were written and false otherwise. This function should only be called by
the component that owns the OUT PORT pin.

=== *hal_port_writable*

Returns the number of bytes that can be written into the port. It is
safe to call this function from any component.

=== *hal_port_buffer_size*

Returns the maximum number of bytes that a port can buffer. It is safe
to call this function from any component.

=== *hal_port_wait_readable*

Waits until the port has count bytes or more available for reading or
the stop flag is set.

=== *hal_port_wait_writable*

Waits until the port has count bytes or more available for writing or
the stop flag is set.

== ARGUMENTS

hal_port_t::
  A handle to a port object. Created by hal_pin_new.
dest::
  An array of bytes that hal_port_read and hal_port_peek will copy data into.
  This must be allocated by the caller and be at least count bytes long.
count::
  The number of bytes that hal_port_read, hal_port_peek, and
  hal_port_write will copy in to dest or out from src.
src::
  An array of bytes that hal_port_write will copy data from into the
  port buffer. This must be of size count bytes or larger.
stop::
  A pointer to a value which is monitored while waiting.
  If it is nonzero, the wait operation returns early.
  This allows a wait call to be safely terminated in the case of a signal.

== SAMPLE CODE

In the source tree under src/hal/components/raster.comp is a realtime
component intended for laser control. src/tests/raster is a test program
that also programs the raster component from Python.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

*hal_port_read*, *hal_port_peek*, *hal_port_peek_commit*,
*hal_port_readable*, *hal_port_clear*, *hal_port_write*,
*hal_port_writable*, *hal_port_buffer_size* may be called from realtime code.

*hal_port_wait_writable*, *hal_port_wait_readable* may be called from ULAPI code.
