= hal_export_funct(3hal)

== NAME

hal_export_funct, hal_export_functf - create a realtime function callable from a thread

== SYNTAX

typedef void(*hal_funct_t)(void* _arg_, long _period_)

int hal_export_funct(const char* _name_, hal_funct_t _funct_, void* _arg_, int _uses_fp_, int _reentrant_, int _comp_id_)

== ARGUMENTS

name::
  The name of the function.
funct::
  The pointer to the function.
arg::
  The argument to be passed as the first parameter of _funct_.
uses_fp::
  Nonzero if the function uses floating-point operations, including
  assignment of floating point values with "=".
reentrant::
  If reentrant is non-zero, the function may be preempted and called again before the first call completes.
  Otherwise, it may only be added to one thread.
comp_id::
  A HAL component identifier returned by an earlier call to *hal_init*.

== DESCRIPTION

*hal_export_funct* makes a realtime function provided by a component available to the system.
A subsequent call to *hal_add_funct_to_thread* can be used to schedule the
execution of the function as needed by the system.

When this function is placed on a HAL thread, and HAL threads are started,
_funct_ is called repeatedly with two arguments:
_void *arg_ is the same value that was given to *hal_export_funct*,
and _long period_ is the interval between calls in nanoseconds.

Each call to the function should do a small amount of work and return.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns a HAL status code.
