== SYNTAX

[source,c]

#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
int hm2_bspi_setup_chan(char* name, int chan, int cs, int bits, float mhz,
                        int delay, int cpol, int cpha, int noclear, int noecho)

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_bspi_setup_chan* allows a realtime component to claim and configure
a BSPI channel on a previously configured hostmot2 board.

name::
  A unique string given to the BSPI channel during hostmot2 setup. The
  names of the available channels are printed to standard output during
  the driver loading process and take the form
  **hm2_**_board-name_**.**_board-index_**.bspi.**_bspi-index_.
  For example, the first index on the first hm2_5i23 board would be called
  `hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0`.
chan::
  Channels are numbered 0 to 15. The value on the chip-select lines is
  set by cs and need not match the channel number.
cs::
  The chip select line(s) to assert when accessing this channel. BSPI
  supports 4 chip select lines, so the valid range for cs is 0-15.
bits::
  sets the bit-length of the SPI packet. The maximum supported length is
  64 bits but this will span two read FIFO entries and will need special
  handling (values 32 and below require no special handling).
mhz::
  sets the chip communication rate. The maximum value for this is half
  the FPGA base frequency, so for example with a 48 MHz 5I23 the max SPI
  frequency is 24 MHz. Values in excess of the max supported will be
  silently rounded down.
delay::
  sets the chip select valid delay (in ns)
cpha and cpol::
  Set the clock phase and polarity (according to the device datasheet).
noclear::
  Controls whether the frame clear bit is set after the 32 bit buffer transfer.
  This parameter should be set to 1 when the frame length is greater than 32 bits and the next data in the FIFO contains the other bits.
noecho::
  Set to 1 for devices which do not return data (such as DACs).
samplelate::
  Set to 1 to sample the received SPI data 1/2 SPI clock later than normal.
  This is useful when high clock rates or isolation cause significant delays from clock to received data.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from within realtime init/cleanup code or non-realtime
components, not from realtime tasks.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
