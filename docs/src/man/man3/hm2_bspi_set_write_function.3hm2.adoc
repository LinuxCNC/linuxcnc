= hm2_bspi_set_write_function(3hm2)

== NAME

hm2_bspi_set_write_function - Register a function to handle the tram
write phase of a hostmot2 buffered SPI driver.

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
int hm2_bspi_set_write_function(char *name, void *func, void *subdata)
----

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_bspi_set_write_function* registers a function in an external driver
to be called every time that the main Hostmot2 driver calls the generic
"prepare_tram_write" functions. The names of the available channels are
printed with rtapi_print_msg during the driver loading process and take
the form:

**hm2_**_<board name>_**.**_<board index>_**.bspi**._<index>_

For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0.

"func" should be a pointer to a function in the sub driver which is to
be called to process the pins into BSPI write registers prior to the
regular TRAM write phase. The function must take a single argument, a
pointer to an individual instance of the internal driver. If defined in
comp then the function must *not* use the FUNCTION() convenience macro,
and the argument to the function in the definition must *always* be
(struct state *inst).

"subdata" is a pointer to the driver instance internal data.
In the case of a driver written in comp this will always be "inst" in the function call.

If using comp then the call to this function should be anywhere in the EXTRA_SETUP code.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from realtime init code, not from other realtime code or non-realtime components.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
