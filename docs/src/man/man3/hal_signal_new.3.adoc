== NAME

hal_signal_new, hal_signal_delete, hal_link, hal_unlink - Manipulate HAL
signals

== SYNTAX

int hal_signal_new(const char* _signal_name_, hal_type_t _type_)

int hal_signal_delete(const char* _signal_name_)

int hal_link(const char* _pin_name_, const char* _signal_name_)

int hal_unlink(const char* _pin_name_)

== ARGUMENTS

signal_name::
  The name of the signal.
pin_name::
  The name of the pin.
type::
  The type of the signal, as specified in *hal_type_t(3hal)*.

== DESCRIPTION

*hal_signal_new* creates a new signal object. Once a signal has been
created, pins can be linked to it with *hal_link*. The signal object
contains the actual storage for the signal data. Pin objects linked to
the signal have pointers that point to the data. 'name' is the name of
the new signal. It may be no longer than HAL_NAME_LEN characters. If
there is already a signal with the same name the call will fail.

*hal_link* links a pin to a signal. If the pin is already linked to the
desired signal, the command succeeds. If the pin is already linked to
some other signal, it is an error. In either case, the existing
connection is not modified. (Use 'hal_unlink' to break an existing
connection.) If the signal already has other pins linked to it, they are
unaffected - one signal can be linked to many pins, but a pin can be
linked to only one signal.

*hal_unlink* unlinks any signal from the specified pin.

*hal_signal_delete* deletes a signal object. Any pins linked to the
object are unlinked.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns a HAL status code.
