== NAME

rtapi_prio, rtapi_prio_highest, rtapi_prio_lowest, rtapi_prio_next_higher, rtapi_prio_next_lower - thread priority functions

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
int rtapi_prio_highest();
int rtapi_prio_lowest();
int rtapi_prio_next_higher(int _prio_);
int rtapi_prio_next_lower(int _prio_);
----

== ARGUMENTS

prio::
  A value returned by a prior *rtapi_prio_xxx* call

== DESCRIPTION

The *rtapi_prio_xxxx* functions provide a portable way to set task
priority. The mapping of actual priority to priority number depends on
the RTOS. Priorities range from *rtapi_prio_lowest* to
*rtapi_prio_highest*, inclusive. To use this API, use one of two methods:

[arabic]
. Set your lowest priority task to *rtapi_prio_lowest*,
  and for each task of the next lowest priority, set their priorities to
  *rtapi_prio_next_higher*(previous).
. Set your highest priority task to *rtapi_prio_highest*,
  and for each task of the next highest priority,
  set their priorities to *rtapi_prio_next_lower*(previous).

N.B.: A high priority task will preempt or interrupt a lower priority task.
Linux is always the lowest priority!

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call these functions only from within init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns an opaque real-time priority number.
