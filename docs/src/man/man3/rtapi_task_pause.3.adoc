== NAME

rtapi_task_pause, rtapi_task_resume - pause and resume real-time tasks

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
void rtapi_task_pause(int _task_id_);
void rtapi_task_resume(int _task_id_);
----

== ARGUMENTS

task_id::
  An RTAPI task identifier returned by an earlier call to *rtapi_task_new*.

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_task_resume* starts a task in free-running mode.
The task must be in the "paused" state.

A free running task runs continuously until either:

[arabic]
. It is prempted by a higher priority task.
  It will resume as soon as the higher priority task releases the CPU.
. It calls a blocking function, like *rtapi_sem_take*.
  It will resume when the function unblocks.
. It is returned to the "paused" state by *rtapi_task_pause*.
  May be called from init/cleanup code, and from within realtime tasks.

*rtapi_task_pause* causes a task to stop execution and change to the
"paused" state. The task can be free-running or periodic. Note that
*rtapi_task_pause* may called from any task, or from init or cleanup
code, not just from the task that is to be paused. The task will resume
execution when either *rtapi_task_resume* or *rtapi_task_start*
(depending on whether this is a free-running or periodic task) is
called.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from init/cleanup code, and from within realtime tasks.

== RETURN VALUE

An RTAPI status code.
