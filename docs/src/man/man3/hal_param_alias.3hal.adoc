= hal_param_alias(3hal)

== NAME

hal_param_alias - create an alternate name for a param

== SYNTAX

int *hal_param_alias*(const char **original_name*, const char **alias*);

== ARGUMENTS

original_name::
  The original name of the param
alias::
  The alternate name that may be used to refer to the param, or NULL to remove any alternate name.

== DESCRIPTION

A param may have two names: the original name
(the one that was passed to a *hal_param_new* function) and an alias.

Usually, aliases are for the convenience of users and should be created and destroyed via halcmd.
However, in some cases it is sensible to create aliases directly in a component.
These cases include the case where a param is renamed, to preserve compatibility with old versions.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns a HAL status code.

== SEE ALSO
