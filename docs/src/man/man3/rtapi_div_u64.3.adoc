= rtapi_div_u64(3rtapi)

== NAME

rtapi_div_u64, rtapi_div_u64_rem, rtapi_div_s64, rtapi_div_s64_rem - unsigned division of a 64-bit number by a 32-bit number

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
__u64 rtapi_div_u64_rem(__u64 dividend, __u32 divisor, __u32* remainder);
__u64 rtapi_div_u64(__u64 dividend, __u32 divisor);
__s64 rtapi_div_s64(__s64 dividend, __s32 divisor);
__s64 rtapi_div_s64_rem(__s64 dividend, __s32 divisor, __s32* remainder);
----

== ARGUMENTS

dividend::
  The value to be divided.
divisor::
  The value to divide by.
remainder::
  Pointer to the location to store the remainder. This may not be a NULL pointer.
  If the remainder is not desired, call *rtapi_div_u64* or *rtapi_div_s64*.

== DESCRIPTION

Perform integer division (and optionally compute the remainder) with a
64-bit dividend and 32-bit divisor.

== RETURN VALUE

The result of integer division of _dividend_ / _divisor_.
In versions with the _remainder_ argument, the remainder is stored in the pointed-to location.

== NOTES

If the result of the division does not fit in the return type, the result is undefined.

This function exists because in kernel space the use of the division
operator on a 64-bit type can lead to an undefined symbol such as
__umoddi3 when the module is loaded.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from init/cleanup code and from within realtime tasks.
Available in non-realtime components.
