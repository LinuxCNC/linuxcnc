== NAME

rtapi_task_new, rtapi_task_delete - create a realtime task

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
int rtapi_task_new(void (*_taskcode_)(void*), void *_arg_, int _prio_,
                   unsigned long _stacksize_, int _uses_fp_);
int rtapi_task_delete(int _task_id_);
----

== ARGUMENTS

taskcode::
  A pointer to the function to be called when the task is started
arg::
  An argument to be passed to the _taskcode_ function when the task is started
prio::
  A task priority value returned by *rtapi_prio_xxxx*
uses_fp::
  A flag that tells the OS whether the task uses floating point or not.
task_id::
  A task ID returned by a previous call to *rtapi_task_new*

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_task_new* creates but does not start a realtime task.
The task is created in the "paused" state.
To start it, call either *rtapi_task_start* for periodic tasks,
or *rtapi_task_resume* for free-running tasks.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from within init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.

== RETURN VALUE

On success, returns a positive integer task ID.
This ID is used for all subsequent calls that need to act on the task.
On failure, returns an RTAPI status code.

== SEE ALSO

rtapi_task_resume(3rtapi)
