== NAME

rtapi_open_as_root - Open a file with "root" privilege

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi.h>
int rtapi_open_as_root(const char *filename, int flags);
----

== ARGUMENTS

filename::
  The filename to open, as in *open(2)*.
  Note that rtapi has no well-defined "current directory",
  so this should be an absolute path, but this is not enforced.
flags::
  The open flags, as in *open(2)*.
  Should never include bits that open or create files (e.g., O_CREAT, O_APPEND, etc)
  as this API is not intended for creating or writing files, but this is not enforced.

== DESCRIPTION

In "uspace" realtime, root privileges are dropped whenever possible.
This API temporarily switches on root privileges to open a file, and
switches them off before returning. This can be useful for example when
accessing device nodes or memory-mapped I/O.

In the case of PCI devices on x86 and x86-64 systems,
prefer the linux-style PCI interfaces provided in *<rtapi_pci.h>*.

== RETURN VALUE

In case of success, the nonnegative file descriptor opened.
If the caller does not close it, it remains open until rtapi_app exits.

In case of failure, a negative errno value.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from realtime initcode in "uspace" realtime.
