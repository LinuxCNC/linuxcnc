== NAME

hm2_uart_setup - setup a Hostmot2 UART

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
int hm2_uart_setup(char* name, int bitrate, s32 tx_mode, s32 rx_mode);

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_uart_setup* Setup the bitrate for the UART named "name".
"name" is a unique string given to each UART during hostmot2 setup.
The names of the available UARTs are printed to standard output during the driver
loading process and take the form: hm2___<board name>__.__<board index>__.uart.__<index>__,
for example `hm2_5i23.0.uart.0`.
The minimum bitrate is approximately 50 bps, and the maximum around the FPGA frequency, 48 MHz for a 5I23.
The UART function allows different RX and TX bitrates, but that is not currently supported by this driver

tx_mode is bit mask defined in the Hostmot2 regmap:
Bit 0..3:: TXEnable delay.
  TXEnable delay specifies the transmit data holdoff time from the TXenable signal valid state.
  This is used for RS-485 (half duplex) operation, to delay transmit data until the driver is enabled,
  allowing for driver enable delays, isolation barrier delays, etc.
  Delay is in units of ClockLow period.
Bit 4:: FIFOError, it indicates that a host push has overflowed the FIFO (Mainly for driver debugging).
Bit 5:: DriveEnableAuto, When set, enables Drive when any data is in FIFO or Xmit Shift register,
  removes drive when FIFO and Xmit shift register are empty.
Bit 6:: DriveEnableBit, If DriveEnableAuto is 0, controls Drive (for software control of Xmit drive).

rx_mode is bit mask defined in the Hostmot2 regmap:
Bit 0:: FalseStart bit Status, 1 = false start bit detected Bit 1 = OverRun Status, 1 = overrun condition detected (no valid stop bit)
Bit 2:: RXMaskEnable, 1= enable RXMask for half duplex operation, 0 = ignore RXMask Bit 4 = FIFOError,
  indicates that a host read has attempted to read more data than available.
  (mainly for driver debugging)
Bit 5:: LostDataError, indicates that data was received with no room in FIFO, therefore lost
Bit 6:: RXMask, RO RXMASK status
Bit 7:: FIFO Has Data

rx_mode and tx_mode registers are currently write-only. There should possibly be a get-status function.

To write only to the tx_mode DriveEnable bit call this function with the bitrate unchanged and -1 as the rx_mode.
To change bitrate without altering mode settings send -1 to both modes.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
