== NAME

rtapi_firmware - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_firmware.h>
struct rtapi_firmware;
int rtapi_request_firmware(const struct rtapi_firmware **fw,
                           const char* name, struct rtapi_device* device);
void rtapi_release_firmware(const struct rtapi_firmware *fw);
----

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi___xxx__ or RTAPI___XXX__ identifier is mapped to the underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not provided by a kernel,
generally another implementation--possibly with reduced functionality--is provided.
(For example, the userspace implementation for rtapi_device_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Typically, these functions may be called from realtime init/cleanup code.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
