== NAME

rtapi_firmware - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

....
#include <rtapi_firmware.h>
struct rtapi_firmware;
int rtapi_request_firmware(const struct rtapi_firmware **fw, const char
                           *name, struct rtapi_device *device);
void rtapi_release_firmware(const struct rtapi_firmware *fw);
....

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI_XXX identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not
provided by a kernel, generally another implementation--possibly with
reduced functionality--is provided. (For example, the userspace
implementation for rtapi_device_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Typically, these functions may be called from realtime init/cleanup
code.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
