= hal_add_funct_to_thread(3hal)

== NAME

hal_add_funct_to_thread, hal_del_funct_from_thread - cause a function to be executed at regular intervals

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
int hal_add_funct_to_thread(const char* funct_name, const char* thread_name, int position)
int hal_del_funct_from_thread(const char* funct_name, const char* thread_name)
----

== ARGUMENTS

funct_name::
  The name of the function.
thread_name::
  The name of the thread.
position::
  The desired location within the thread.
  This determines when the function will run, in relation to other functions in the thread.
  A positive number indicates the desired location as measured from the
  beginning of the thread, and a negative is measured from the end.
  So +1 means this function will become the first one to run, +5 means it
  will be the fifth one to run, -2 means it will be next to last, and -1
  means it will be last. Zero is illegal.

== DESCRIPTION

*hal_add_funct_to_thread* adds a function exported by a realtime HAL component to a realtime thread.
This determines how often and in what order functions are executed.

*hal_del_funct_from_thread* removes a function from a thread.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns a HAL status code.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from realtime init code, not from other realtime or non-realtime code.

== SEE ALSO

hal_thread_new(3hal), hal_export_funct(3hal)
