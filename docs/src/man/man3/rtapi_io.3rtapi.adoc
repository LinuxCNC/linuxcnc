== NAME

rtapi_io - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

[source,c]

#include <rtapi_io.h>

unsigned int rtapi_inl(unsigned short int port);

unsigned void rtapi_outl(unsigned int value, unsigned short int port);

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi___xxx__ or RTAPI___XXX__ identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not
provided by a kernel, generally another implementation--possibly with
reduced functionality--is provided. (For example, the userspace
implementation for rtapi_device_register and the kernel space
implementation of rtapi_ioperm always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call from init/cleanup code and from realtime tasks. These functions
will cause illegal instruction exceptions in non-realtime components, as
well as in uspace rtapi_app when it is not setuid root.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
