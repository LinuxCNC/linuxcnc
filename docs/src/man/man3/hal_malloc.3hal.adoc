= hal_malloc(3hal)

== NAME

hal_malloc - Allocate space in the HAL shared memory area

== SYNTAX

void *hal_malloc(long int _size_)

== ARGUMENTS

size::
  Gives the size, in bytes, of the block.

== DESCRIPTION

*hal_malloc* allocates a block of memory from the main HAL shared memory
area. It should be used by all components to allocate memory for HAL
pins and parameters. It allocates `size' bytes, and returns a pointer to
the allocated space, or NULL (0) on error. The returned pointer will be
properly aligned for any type HAL supports. A component should allocate
during initialization all the memory it needs.

The allocator is very simple, and there is no `free'. The entire HAL
shared memory area is freed when the last component calls *hal_exit*.
This means that if you continuously install and remove one component
while other components are present, you eventually will fill up the
shared memory and an install will fail. Removing all components
completely clears memory and you start fresh.

== RETURN VALUE

A pointer to the allocated space, which is properly aligned for any
variable HAL supports. Returns NULL on error.
