== SYNTAX

[source,c]

----

== ARGUMENTS

As for _snprintf(3)_ or _vsnprintf(3)_.

== DESCRIPTION

These functions work like the standard C printf functions, except that a
reduced set of formatting operations are supported.

In particular: formatting of long long values is not supported.
Formatting of floating-point values is done as though with %A even when
other formats like %f are specified.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from non-realtime, init/cleanup, and realtime code.

== RETURN VALUE

The number of characters written to _buf_.

== SEE ALSO
