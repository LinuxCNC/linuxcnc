== NAME

rtapi_snprintf, rtapi_vsnprintf - Perform snprintf-like string formatting

== SYNTAX

....
int rtapi_snprintf(char *_buf_, unsigned long int _size_,
                   const char *_fmt_, _..._);
int rtapi_vsnprintf(char *_buf_, unsigned long int _size_,
                    const char *_fmt_, va_list _apf);
....

== ARGUMENTS

As for _snprintf(3)_ or _vsnprintf(3)_.

== DESCRIPTION

These functions work like the standard C printf functions, except that a
reduced set of formatting operations are supported.

In particular: formatting of long long values is not supported.
Formatting of floating-point values is done as though with %A even when
other formats like %f are specified.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from non-realtime, init/cleanup, and realtime code.

== RETURN VALUE

The number of characters written to _buf_.

== SEE ALSO

printf(3)
