== NAME

rtapi_device - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

....
#include <rtapi_device.h>
struct rtapi_device;
int rtapi_dev_set_name(struct rtapi_device *dev, const char *name, ...);
int rtapi_device_register(struct rtapi_device *dev);
int rtapi_device_unregister(struct rtapi_device *dev);
....

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI_XXX identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not
provided by a kernel, generally another implementation--possibly with
reduced functionality--is provided. (For example, the userspace
implementation for rtapi_device_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Typically, these functions may be called from realtime init/cleanup
code.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
