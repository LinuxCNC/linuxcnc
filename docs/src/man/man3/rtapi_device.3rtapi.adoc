== NAME

rtapi_device - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_device.h>
struct rtapi_device;
int rtapi_dev_set_name(struct rtapi_device* dev, const char* name, ...);
int rtapi_device_register(struct rtapi_device* dev);
int rtapi_device_unregister(struct rtapi_device* dev);
----

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each `rtapi_`__xxx__ or `RTAPI_`__XXX__ identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not provided by a kernel,
generally another implementation--possibly with reduced functionality--is provided.
(For example, the userspace implementation for rtapi_device_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Typically, these functions may be called from realtime init/cleanup code.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
