== NAME

rtapi_slab - RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include <rtapi_slab.h>

void *rtapi_kmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t g);
void *rtapi_kzalloc(size_t size, gfp_t g);
void *rtapi_krealloc(size_t size, gfp_t g);
void rtapi_kfree(void*);
----

== DESCRIPTION

In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI___XXX__ identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not provided by a kernel,
generally another implementation -- possibly with reduced functionality -- is provided.
(For example, the userspace implementation for rtapi_device_register always succeeds)

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from within init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.
This function is not available from non-realtime code.

== RETURN VALUE

As in Linux.
