== NAME

hm2_bspi_set_read_function - Register a function to handle the tram
write phase of a hostmot2 buffered SPI driver.

== SYNTAX

....
#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
int hm2_bspi_set_read_function(char *name, void *func, void *subdata)
....

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_bspi_set_read_function* registers a function in an external driver
to be called every time that the main Hostmot2 driver calls the generic
"process_tram_read" function. The names of the available channels are
printed with rtapi_print_msg during the driver loading process and take
the form:

____
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index>
____

For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0.

"func" should be a pointer to a function in the sub driver which is to
be called to process the results of the BSPI TRAM read phase. The
function must take a single argument, a pointer to an individual
instance of the internal driver. If defined in comp then the function
must *not* use the FUNCTION() convenience macro, and the argument to the
function in the definition must *always* be (struct state *inst).

"subdata" is a pointer to the driver instance internal data. In the case
of a driver written in comp this will always be "inst" in the function
call and the call should be anywhere in the EXTRA_SETUP code.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from realtime init code, not from other realtime code or
non-realtime components.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
