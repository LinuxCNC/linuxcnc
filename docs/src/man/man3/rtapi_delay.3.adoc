= rtapi_delay(3rtapi)

== NAME

rtapi_delay, rtapi_delay_max - Busy-loop for short delays

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
void rtapi_delay(long int _nsec_);
void rtapi_delay_max();
----

== ARGUMENTS

nsec::
  The desired delay length in nanoseconds.

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_delay* is a simple delay.
It is intended only for short delays, since it simply loops, wasting CPU cycles.

*rtapi_delay_max* returns the max delay permitted (usually approximately 1/4 of the clock period).
Any call to *rtapi_delay* requesting a delay longer than the max will delay for the max time only.

*rtapi_delay_max* should be called before using *rtapi_delay* to make sure the required delays can be achieved.
The actual resolution of the delay may be as good as one nano-second, or as bad as a several microseconds.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

May be called from init/cleanup code, and from within realtime tasks.

== RETURN VALUE

*rtapi_delay_max* returns the maximum delay permitted.

== SEE ALSO
