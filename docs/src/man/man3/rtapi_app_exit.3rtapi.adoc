== NAME

rtapi_app_exit - User-provided function to shut down a component

== SYNTAX

....
#include <rtapi_app.h>
void rtapi_app_exit(void);
....

== ARGUMENTS

None

== DESCRIPTION

The body of *rtapi_app_exit*, which is provided by the component author,
generally consists of a call to rtapi_exit or hal_exit, preceded by
other component-specific shutdown code.

This code is called when unloading a component which successfully
initialized (i.e., returned zero from its *rtapi_app_main*). It is not
called when the component did not successfully initialize.

== RETURN VALUE

None.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Called automatically by the rtapi infrastructure in an initialization
(not realtime) context.

== SEE ALSO

rtapi_app_main(3rtapi), rtapi_exit(3rtapi), hal_exit(3hal)
