== NAME

rtapi_parport - portable access to PC-style parallel ports

== SYNTAX

[source,c]
----
#include "rtapi_parport.h"

int rtapi_parport_get(const char* _module_name_, rtapi_parport_t* _port_,
                      short _base_, unsigned short _base_hi_,
                      int _modes_);
void rtapi_parport_release(rtapi_parport_t* _port_);
----

== ARGUMENTS

module_name::
  By convention, the name of the RTAPI module or HAL component using the parport.
port::
  A pointer to a rtapi_parport_t structure.
base::
  The base address of the port (if port >= 16) or the linux port number
  of the port (if port < 16).
base_hi::
  The "high" address of the port (location of the ECP registers),
  0 to use a probed high address, or -1 to disable the high address.
modes::
  Advise the driver of the desired port modes, from <linux/parport.h>.
  If a linux-detected port does not provide the requested modes, a
  warning is printed with rtapi_print_msg. This does not make the port
  request fail, because unfortunately, many systems that have working
  EPP parports are not detected as such by Linux.

== DESCRIPTION

*rtapi_parport_get* allocates a parallel port for exclusive use of the
named hal component. If successful, access the port with I/O calls such
as rtapi_inb at address based at the *base* or *base_hi* addresses. The
port must be released with *rtapi_parport_release* before the component
exits with *rtapi_exit*.

== HIGH ADDRESS PROBING

If the port is a parallel port known to Linux, and Linux detected a high
I/O address, this value is used. Otherwise, if base+0x400 is not
registered to any device, it is used. Otherwise, no address is used. If
no high address is detected, port->base_hi is 0.

== PARPORT STRUCTURE

[source,c]
----
typedef struct
{
    unsigned short base;
    unsigned short base_hi;
    .... // and further unspecified fields
} rtapi_parport_t;
----

== RETURN VALUE

*rtapi_parport_get* returns a HAL status code. On success, _port_ is
filled out with information about the allocated port.
On failure, the contents of _port_ are undefined except that it is safe
(but not required) to pass this port to *rtapi_parport_release*.

*rtapi_parport_release* does not return a value. It always succeeds.

== NOTES

In new code, prefer use of rtapi_parport to rtapi_parport.
