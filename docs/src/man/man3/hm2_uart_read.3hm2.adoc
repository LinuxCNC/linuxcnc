== NAME

hm2_uart_read - read data from a Hostmot2 UART buffer

== SYNTAX

....
#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
int hm2_uart_read(char *name, unsigned char *data);
....

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_uart_read* read data from the UART "name". "name" is a unique
string given to each UART during hostmot2 setup. The names of the
available channels are printed to standard output during the driver
loading process and take the form:
hm2___<board name>__.__<board index>__.uart.__<index>__
For example: `hm2_5i23.0.uart.0`.

This function reads a variable number of bytes from the the specified channel.
It should be used inside a realtime HAL component registered with the main
hostmot2 driver using the function `hm2_uart_set_read_function` in the setup code.

Note that the UART Receive FIFO is only 16 bytes deep,(the transmit FIFO is 64 bytes)
and "data" needs to be at least that large or undefined mayhem will ensue.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns the number of bytes read on success and -1 on failure.

== SEE ALSO

hm2_uart_setup(3hm2), hm2_uart_send(3hm2)

See src/hal/drivers mesa_uart.comp for an example usage.
