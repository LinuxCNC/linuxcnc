= hal_parport(3hal)

== NAME

hal_parport - portable access to PC-style parallel ports

== SYNTAX

....
#include "hal_parport.h"
int hal_parport_get(int _comp_id_, hal_parport_t* _port_, unsigned short _base_, unsigned short _base_hi_, unsigned int _modes_)
void hal_parport_release(hal_parport_t* _port_)
....

== ARGUMENTS

comp_id::
  A HAL component identifier returned by an earlier call to *hal_init*.
port::
  A pointer to a hal_parport_t structure.
base::
  The base address of the port (if port >= 16) or the linux port number of the port (if port < 16)
base_hi::
  The "high" address of the port (location of the ECP registers),
  0 to use a probed high address, or -1 to disable the high address
modes::
  Advise the driver of the desired port modes, from <linux/parport.h>.
  If a linux-detected port does not provide the requested modes,
  a warning is printed with rtapi_print_msg.
  This does not make the port request fail, because unfortunately,
  many systems that have working EPP parports are not detected as such by Linux.

== DESCRIPTION

*hal_parport_get* allocates a parallel port for exclusive use of the named HAL component.
The port must be released with *hal_parport_release* before the component exits with *hal_exit*.

== HIGH ADDRESS PROBING

If the port is a parallel port known to Linux, and Linux detected a high
I/O address, this value is used. Otherwise, if base+0x400 is not
registered to any device, it is used. Otherwise, no address is used.
If no high address is detected, port->base_hi is 0.

== PARPORT STRUCTURE

....
typedef struct
{
    unsigned short base;
    unsigned short base_hi;
    .... // and further unspecified fields
} hal_parport_t;
....

== RETURN VALUE

*hal_parport_get* returns a HAL status code.
On success, _port_ is filled out with information about the allocated port.
On failure, the contents of _port_ are undefined except that it is safe
(but not required) to pass this port to *hal_parport_release*.

*hal_parport_release* does not return a value. It always succeeds.

== NOTES

In new code, prefer use of rtapi_parport to hal_parport.
