== NAME

hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame - add a register-write to the Hostmot2 TRAM

== SYNTAX

....
#include <hostmot2-serial.h>
hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame(char* name, int chan, u32** wbuff, u32** rbuff);
....

== DESCRIPTION

*hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame* Add a regular (every thread) write event to
the Hostmot2 tram for bspi instance "name". "name" is a unique string
given to each bspi channel during hostmot2 setup. The names of the
available channels are printed to standard output during the driver
loading process and take the form: hm2_<board name>.<board
index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0

This function is used to add a regular, every thread, write or
write-read transaction to the Translation RAM system. A write need not
have a read (use 0 for _rbuff_) but it is an error to have a read
without a write. Note that the TRAM list is not actioned until the
hm2_allocate_bspi_tram function is called. The read and write parameters
must be pointers to pointers, as TRAM re-maps the buffers into contiguous memory.

== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS

Call only from realtime init code, not from other realtime code or non-realtime components.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
