== NAME

halrun - manipulate the LinuxCNC HAL from the command line

== SYNOPSIS

*halrun -h*

*halrun [*-I*] [_halcmd_opts_] [_filename[.hal|.tcl]_]

*halrun -T* [_halcmd_opts_] [_filename[.hal|.tcl]_]

*halrun -U*

== DESCRIPTION

The convenience script *halrun* can manipulate the HAL (Hardware
Abstraction Layer) from the command line. When invoked, *halrun*:

* Sets up the realtime environment.
* Executes a command interpreter (*halcmd* or *haltcl*).
* (Optionally) runs an interactive session.
* Tears down the realtime environment.

If no filename is specified, an interactive session is started.
The session will use *halcmd*(1) unless -T is specified in which case *haltcl*(1) will be used.

If a filename is specified and neither the -I nor the -T option is included,
the filename will be processed by the command interpreter
corresponding to the filename extension (*halcmd* or *haltcl*).
After processing, the realtime environment will be torn down.

If a filename is specified and the -I or -T option is included,
the file is processed by the appropriate command interpreter and then an
interactive session is started for *halcmd* or *haltcl* according to the -I or -T option.

== OPTIONS

*halcmd_opts*::
  When a .hal file is specified, the *halcmd_opts* are passed to *halcmd*.
  See the man page for **halcmd**(1).
  When a .tcl file is specified, the only valid options are: -i <INI file> -f <filename[.tcl|.hal]> (alternate means of specifying a file).
*-I*::
  Run an interactive *halcmd* session
*-T*::
  Run an interactive *haltcl* session.
*-U*::
  Forcibly cause the realtime environment to exit. It releases the HAL
  mutex, requests that all HAL components unload, and stops the realtime
  system. *-U* must be the only commandline argument.
*-h*::
  Display a brief help screen and exit.
