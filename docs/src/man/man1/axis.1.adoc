== NAME

axis - AXIS LinuxCNC Graphical User Interface

== SYNOPSIS

*axis* _-ini_ _INIFILE_

== DESCRIPTION

*axis* is one of the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for LinuxCNC. It
gets run by the runscript usually.

== OPTIONS

_INIFILE_::
  The INI file is the main piece of an LinuxCNC configuration. It is not
  the entire configuration; there are various other files that go with
  it (NML files, HAL files, TBL files, VAR files). It is, however, the
  most important one, because it is the file that holds the
  configuration together. It can adjust a lot of parameters itself, but
  it also tells *LinuxCNC* which other files to load and use.

== SEE ALSO

Much more information about LinuxCNC and HAL is available in the
