== NAME

hy_gt_vfd - HAL non-realtime component for Huanyang GT-series VFDs


== SYNOPSIS

*hy_gt_vfd* [_OPTIONS_]


== DESCRIPTION

The hy_gt_vfd component interfaces a Huanyang GT-series VFD to the LinuxCNC HAL.
The VFD is connected via RS-485 serial to the LinuxCNC computer.


== Hardware setup

At least some Huanyang GT VFDs must be physically modified to enable Modbus communication.

The circuit board location marked "SW1" is identified in the manual as "Switch of terminal resistor for RS485 communication".
On the only VFD I have experience with, the circuit board contained no switch at that location, instead holding a pair of crossed jumper wires (top-left pad connected to bottom-right pad, top-right to bottom-left).
In this configuration, no Modbus communication is possible.
We had to desolder the two crossed jumper wires and re-solder them parallel to each other (top-left to bottom-left, top-right to bottom-right).


== Firmware setup

The Huanyang GT VFD must be configure via the faceplate to talk Modbus with LinuxCNC.
Consult the Operation section of the Huanyang GT-series Inverter Manual for details.
Set the following parameters:

P0.01 = 2::
    Set Run Command Source to Modbus serial port.

P0.03::
    Set Maximum Frequency to the maximum frequency you want the VFD to output, in Hz.

P0.04::
    Set Upper Frequency Limit to the maximum frequency you want the VFD to output, in Hz.
    This should be the same as the value in P0.03.

P0.05::
    Set Lower Frequency Limit to the minimum frequency you want the VFD to output, in Hz.

P0.07 = 7::
    Set Frequency A Command Source to Modbus serial port.

P2.01 = ???::
    Set Motor Rated Power to the motor's power rating in kW.

P2.02 = ???::
    Set Motor Rated Frequency to the motor's max frequency in Hz.

P2.03 = ???::
    Set Motor Rated Speed to the motor's speed in RPM at its rated maximum frequency.

P2.04 = ???::
    Set Motor Rated Voltage to the motor's maximum voltage, in Volts.

P2.05 = ???::
    Set Motor Rated Current to the motor's maximum current, in Amps.

PC.00 = 1::
    Set Local Address to 1.
    This matches the default in the hy_gt_vfd driver, change this if your setup has special needs.

PC.01 = 5::
    Set baud rate selection to 5 (38400 bps).
    This matches the default in the hy_gt_vfd driver, change this if your setup has special needs.
    +
        0 = 1200
        1 = 2400
        2 = 4800
        3 = 9600
        4 = 19200
        5 = 38400

PC.02 = 0::
    Set Data Format (8n1 RTU).
    This matches the default in the hy_gt_vfd driver, change this if your setup has special needs.

PC.03 = 1::
    Set Communication Delay Time to 1 ms.
    This is expected by the hy_gt_vfd driver.

== PINS

*hy_gt_vfd.period* (float, in)::
    The period for the driver's update cycle, in seconds. This is
    how frequently the driver will wake up, check its HAL pins, and
    communicate with the VFD.  Must be between 0.001 and 2.000 seconds.
    Default: 0.1 seconds.

*hy_gt_vfd.fault-info-code* (u32, out)::
    The VFD's fault code register value.  Introduced in LinuxCNC version 2.10.  0x00 if no fault is detected, see GT Series Inverter Manual page 87 for list of fault codes.

== ISSUES

The VFD produces the output frequency that it sends to the motor by adding a manually specified offset to the frequency command it gets over modbus.

The manual offset is controlled by pressing the Up/Down arrows on the faceplate while the VFD is turning the motor.

If you command a speed on the .speed-cmd pin and get a different speed reported on the .speed-fb pin, first verify that the VFD registers listed in the FIRMWARE SETUP section above and
the driver's command-line arguments all agree with the info on the motor's name plate.
If you still aren't getting the speed you expect, zero the VFD's frequency offset by starting the motor running, then pressing the Up/Down buttons to zero the offset.
