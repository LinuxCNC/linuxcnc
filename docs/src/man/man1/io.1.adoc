= io(1)

== NAME

io - interacts with HAL or G-code in non-realtime

== SYNOPSIS

*[EMCIO]* +
*EMCIO = io*

== DESCRIPTION

I/O control handles I/O tasks like coolant, toolchange and E-stop.
The signals are turned on and off in non-realtime with G-code or in the case
of E-stop in HAL.

The following pins are created by the non-realtime IO controller,
usually found in `$LINUXCNC_HOME/bin/io`.

iocontrol is a non-realtime process - if you have strict timing
requirements or simply need more I/O, consider using the realtime
synchronized I/O provided by *motion*(9) instead.

The INI file is searched for in the directory from which halcmd was run,
unless an absolute path is specified.

== PINS

*iocontrol.0.coolant-flood* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when flood coolant is requested.
*iocontrol.0.coolant-mist* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when mist coolant is requested.
*iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in* (Bit, In)::
  Should be driven FALSE when an external E-stop condition exists.
*iocontrol.0.tool-change* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when a tool change is requested.
*iocontrol.0.tool-changed* (Bit, In)::
  Should be driven TRUE when a tool change is completed.
*iocontrol.0.tool-number* (s32, Out)::
  Current tool number.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prep-number* (s32, Out)::
  The number of the next tool, from the RS274NGC T-word.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prep-pocket* (s32, Out)::
  This is the pocket number (location in the tool storage
  mechanism) of the tool requested by the most recent T-word.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prepare* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when a T__n__ tool prepare is requested.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prepared* (Bit, In)::
  Should be driven TRUE when a tool prepare is completed.
*iocontrol.0.user-enable-out* (Bit, Out)::
  FALSE when an internal E-stop condition exists.
*iocontrol.0.user-request-enable* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when the user has requested that E-stop be cleared.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prep-index* (s32, Out)::
  IO's internal array index of the prepped tool requested by the most recent T-word.
  0 if no tool is prepped.  On Random toolchanger machines this is the tool's pocket number
  (i.e., the same as the tool-prep-pocket pin),
  on Non-random toolchanger machines this is a small integer corresponding to
  the tool's location in the internal representation of the tool table.
  This parameter returns to 0 after a successful tool change (M6).
