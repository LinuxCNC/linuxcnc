== NAME

gs2_vfd - HAL non-realtime component for Automation Direct GS2 VFDs

== SYNOPSIS

*gs2_vfd* [OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION

This manual page explains the *gs2_vfd* component. This component reads
and writes to the GS2 via a modbus connection.

*gs2_vfd* is for use with LinuxCNC.

== OPTIONS

-b, --bits _n_::
  Set number of data bits to _n_, where _n_ must be from 5 to 8 inclusive (default 8).

-d, --device _path_::
  Set the path to the file representing the serial device to use (default /dev/ttyS0).

-v, --verbose::
  Turn on verbose mode.

-g, --debug::
  Turn on debug messages. Note that if there are serial errors, this may become annoying.
  Debug mode will cause all modbus messages to be printed in hex on the terminal.

-n, --name _string_::
  Set the name of the HAL module. The HAL comp name will be set to _string_,
  and all pin and parameter names will begin with _string_ (default gs2_vfd).

-p, --parity [even,odd,none]::
  Set serial parity to even, odd, or none (default odd).

-r, --rate n::
  Set baud rate to _n_. It is an error if the rate is
  not one of the following: 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
  19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 (default 38400).

-s, --stopbits [1,2]::
  Set serial stop bits to 1 or 2 (default 1).

-t, --target <n>::
  Set MODBUS target (slave) number.
  This must match the device number you set on the GS2 (default 1).

-A, --accel-seconds <n>::
  Seconds to accelerate the spindle from 0 to Max RPM (default 10.0).

-D, --decel-seconds <n>::
  Seconds to decelerate the spindle from Max RPM to 0.
  If set to 0.0 the spindle will be allowed to coast to a stop without
  controlled deceleration (default 0.0).

-R, --braking-resistor::
  This argument should be used when a braking resistor is installed
  on the GS2 VFD (see Appendix A of the GS2 manual).
  It disables deceleration over-voltage stall prevention (see GS2 modbus Parameter 6.05),
  allowing the VFD to keep braking even in situations where the motor is regenerating high voltage.
  The regenerated voltage gets safely dumped into the braking resistor.

== PINS

<name>.DC-bus-volts (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.at-speed (bit, out)::
  when drive is at commanded speed

<name>.err-reset (bit, in)::
  reset errors sent to VFD

<name>.firmware-revision (s32, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.frequency-command (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.frequency-out (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.is-stopped (bit, out)::
  when the VFD reports 0 Hz output

<name>.load-percentage (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.motor-RPM (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.output-current (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.output-voltage (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.power-factor (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.scale-frequency (float, out)::
  from the VFD

<name>.speed-command (float, in)::
  speed sent to VFD in RPM. It is an error to send a speed faster than
  the Motor Max RPM as set in the VFD.

<name>.spindle-fwd (bit, in)::
  1 for FWD and 0 for REV sent to VFD

<name>.spindle-on (bit, in)::
  1 for ON and 0 for OFF sent to VFD, only on when running

<name>.spindle-rev (bit, in)::
  1 for ON and 0 for OFF, only on when running

<name>.status-1 (s32, out)::
  Drive Status of the VFD (see the GS2 manual)

<name>.status-2 (s32, out)::
  Drive Status of the VFD (see the GS2 manual) Note that the value is a
  sum of all the bits that are on. So a 163 which means the drive is in
  the run mode is the sum of 3 (run) + 32 (freq set by serial) + 128
  (operation set by serial).

== PARAMETERS

<name>.error-count (s32, RW)::

<name>.loop-time (float, RW)::
  how often the modbus is polled (default 0.1)

<name>.nameplate-HZ (float, RW)::
  Nameplate Hz of motor (default 60)

<name>.nameplate-RPM (float, RW)::
  Nameplate RPM of motor (default 1730)

<name>.retval (s32, RW)::
  the return value of an error in HAL

<name>.tolerance (float, RW)::
  speed tolerance (default 0.01)

<name>.ack-delay (s32, RW)::
  number of read/write cycles before checking at-speed (default 2)
