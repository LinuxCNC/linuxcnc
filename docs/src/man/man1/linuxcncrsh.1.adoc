== NAME

linuxcncrsh - text-mode interface for commanding LinuxCNC over the network

== SYNOPSIS

*linuxcncrsh* [OPTIONS] [-- LINUXCNC_OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION

The command *linuxcncrsh* is a fully-functional text-based user interface for LinuxCNC.
Instead of popping up a GUI window like AXIS(1) and Touchy(1) do,
it processes text-mode commands that it receives via the network.
A human (or a program) can interface with *linuxcncrsh* using telnet(1), nc(1) or similar programs.

It cannot be stressed enough that all features of LinuxCNC are available
via the *linuxcncrsh* interface. It can substitute a graphical UI or be
started in addition to it. If your environment needs to control/monitor
more than one machine from a single location, this text interface may raise
your interest. Also, a speech to text interface may be easier to adapt to
this text-based interface than to a graphical one.

== OPTIONS

*-p*,*--port* _PORT_NUMBER_::
  Specify the port for linuxcncrsh to listen on. Defaults to 5007 if omitted.

*-n*,*--name* _SERVER_NAME_::
  Sets the server name that linuxcncrsh will use to identify itself during
  handshaking with a new client. Defaults to EMCNETSVR if omitted.

*-w*,*--connectpw* PASSWORD::
  Specify the connection password to use during handshaking with a new client.
  Note that the password is sent in the clear, so it can be read by anyone
  who can read packets on the network between the server and the client.
  Defaults to EMC if omitted.

*-e*,*--enablepw* _PASSWORD_::
  Specify the password required to enable LinuxCNC via linuxcncrsh.
  Note that the password is sent in the clear, so it can be read by anyone
  who can read packets on the network between the server and the client.
  Defaults to EMCTOO if omitted.

*-s*,*--sessions* _MAX_SESSIONS_::
  Specify the maximum number of simultaneous connections.
  Defaults to -1 (no limit) if not specified.
  +
  In addition to the options listed above, linuxcncrsh accepts an optional
  special LINUXCNC_OPTION at the end:

*-ini* _LINUXCNC_INI_FILE_::
  LinuxCNC INI file to use. The -ini option *must* be preceded by two dashes: "--".
  Defaults to 'emc.ini' if omitted.

== Starting linuxcncrsh

To use *linuxcncrsh* instead of a normal LinuxCNC GUI like AXIS or Touchy,
specify it in your INI file like this:

----
[DISPLAY]

DISPLAY=linuxcncrsh
----

To use linuxcncrsh in addition to a normal GUI, you can either
1. start it at the end of your HAL file, or
2. run it by hand in a terminal window.

To start it from HAL, add a line like this to the end of your HAL file:

----
loadusr linuxcncrsh [OPTIONS] [-- LINUXCNC_OPTIONS]
----

To start it from the terminal, run `linuxcncrsh` manually like this:

----
linuxcncrsh [OPTIONS] [-- LINUXCNC_OPTIONS]
----

== Connecting

Once LinuxCNC is up and *linuxcncrsh* is running, you can connect to it
using *telnet* or *nc* or similar:

*telnet* _HOST_ _PORT_::
  _HOST_ is the hostname or IP address of the computer running linuxcncrsh,
  and _PORT_ is the port it's listening on
  (5007 if you did not give linuxcncrsh the --port option).

== Network protocol

linuxcncrsh accepts TCP connections on the port specified by the --port option,
or 5007 if not specified.

The client sends requests, and the linuxcncrsh server returns replies.
Requests consist of a command word followed by optional command-specific parameters.
Requests and most request parameters are case insensitive.
The exceptions are passwords, file paths and text strings.

Requests to linuxcncrsh are terminated with line endings,
any combination of one or more '\r' and '\n' characters.
Replies from linuxcncrsh are terminated with the sequence '\r\n'.

The supported commands are as follows:

*hello* _<password>_ _<client>_ _<version>_::
  <password> must match linuxcncrsh's connect password, or "EMC" if no --connectpw was supplied.
  The three arguments may not contain whitespace.
  If a valid password was entered the server will respond with:
  +
  `HELLO ACK <ServerName> <ServerVersion>`
  +
  If an invalid password or any other syntax error occurs then the server responds with:
  +
  `HELLO NAK`

*get* _<subcommand>_ _[<parameters>]_::
  The get command takes one of the LinuxCNC sub-commands (described in the
  section *LinuxCNC Subcommands*, below) and zero or more additional
  subcommand-specific parameters.

*set* _<subcommand>_ _<parameters>_::
  The set command takes one of the LinuxCNC sub-commands (described in the
  section *LinuxCNC Subcommands*, below) and one or more additional parameters.

*quit*::
  The quit command disconnects the associated socket connection.

*shutdown*::
  The shutdown command tells LinuxCNC to shutdown and disconnect the session.
  This command may only be issued if the Hello has been successfully negotiated
  and the connection has control of the CNC
  (see *enable* subcommand in the *LinuxCNC Subcommands* section, below).

*help*::
  The help command will return help information in text format over the connection.
  If no parameters are specified, it will itemize the available commands.
  If a command is specified, it will provide usage information for the specified command.
  Help will respond regardless of whether a "Hello" has been successfully negotiated.

== LinuxCNC Subcommands

Subcommands for *get* and *set* are:

*echo* {on|off}::
  With get, any on/off parameter is ignored and the current echo state is returned.
  With set, sets the echo state as specified.
  Echo defaults to on when the connection is first established.
  When echo is on, all commands will be echoed upon receipt.
  This state is local to each connection.

*verbose* {on|off}::
  With get, any on/off parameter is ignored and the current verbose state is returned.
  With set, sets the verbose state as specified. When verbose mode is on
  all set commands return positive acknowledgement in the form
  +
  SET <COMMAND> ACK
  +
  and text error messages will be issued (FIXME: I don't know what this means).
  The verbose state is local to each connection, and starts out OFF on new connections.

*enable* { _<passwd>_ | off }::
  The session's enable state indicates whether the current connection is enabled to perform control functions.
  With get, any parameter is ignored, and the current enable state is returned.
  With set and a valid password matching linuxcncrsh's --enablepw (EMCTOO if not specified),
  the current connection is enabled for control functions. "OFF" may not
  be used as a password and disables control functions for this connection.

*config* [TBD]::
  Unused, ignore for now.

*comm_mode* { ascii | binary }::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current communications mode is returned.
  With set, will set the communications mode to the specified mode.
  The ASCII mode is the text request/reply mode, the binary protocol is not currently designed or implemented.

*comm_prot* _<version>_::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current protocol version used
  by the server is returned. With set, sets the server to use the
  specified protocol version, provided it is lower than or equal to the
  highest version number supported by the server implementation.

*inifile*::
  Not currently implemented! With get, returns the string 'emc.ini'.
  Should return the full path and file name of the current configuration INI file.
  Setting this does nothing.

*plat*::
  With get, returns the string 'Linux'.

*ini* _<var>_ _<section>_::
  Not currently implemented, do not use!
  Should return the string value of _<var>_ in section _<section>_ of the INI file.

*debug* _<value>_::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current integer value of
  EMC_DEBUG is returned. Note that the value of EMC_DEBUG returned is the
  from the UI's INI file, which may be different than emc's INI file. With
  set, sends a command to the EMC to set the new debug level, and sets the
  EMC_DEBUG global here to the same value. This will make the two values
  the same, since they really ought to be the same.

*wait_mode* { received | done }::
  The wait_mode setting controls the wait after receiving a command.
  It can be "received" (after the command was sent and received) or "done"
  (after the command was done).
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current wait_mode setting is returned.
  With set, set the wait_mode setting to the specified value.

*wait* { received | done }::
  With set, force a wait for the previous command to be received, or done.

*set_timeout* _<timeout>_::
  With set, set the timeout for commands to return to <timeout> seconds.
  Timeout is a real number. If it's <= 0.0, it means wait forever.
  Default is 0.0, wait forever.

*update* { none | auto }::
  The update mode controls whether to return fresh or stale values for "get" requests.
  When the update mode is "none" it returns stale values,
  when it's "auto" it returns fresh values.
  Defaults to "auto" for new connections.
  Set this to "none" if you like to be confused.

*error*::
  With get, returns the current error string, or "ok" if no error.

*operator_display*::
  With get, returns the current operator display string, or "ok" if none.

*operator_text*::
  With get, returns the current operator text string, or "ok" if none.

*time*::
  With get, returns the time, in seconds, from the start of the epoch.
  This starting time depends on the platform.

*estop* { on | off }::
  With get, ignores any parameters and returns the current estop setting
  as "on" or "off". With set, sets the estop as specified. E-stop "on"
  means the machine is in the estop state and won't run.

*machine* { on | off }::
  With get, ignores any parameters and returns the current machine power setting as "on" or "off".
  With set, sets the machine on or off as specified.

*mode* { manual | auto | mdi }::
  With get, ignores any parameters and returns the current machine mode.
  With set, sets the machine mode as specified.

*mist* { on | off }::
  With get, ignores any parameters and returns the current mist coolant setting.
  With set, sets the mist setting as specified.

*flood* { on | off }::
  With get, ignores any parameters and returns the current flood coolant setting.
  With set, sets the flood setting as specified.

*spindle* { forward | reverse | increase | decrease | constant | off } {_<spindle>_}::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current spindle state is returned as
  "forward", "reverse", "increase", "decrease", or "off".
  With set, sets the spindle as specified. Note that "increase" and "decrease"
  will cause a speed change in the corresponding direction until a "constant" command is sent.
  If "spindle" is omitted, spindle 0 is selected.  If -1, all spindles are selected.

*brake* { on | off } {<spindle>}::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current brake setting is returned.
  With set, the brake is set as specified.
  If "spindle" is omitted, spindle 0 is selected.
  If -1, all spindles are selected.

  With get, returns the currently applied tool length offset.

*load_tool_table* <file>::
  With set, loads the tool table specified by <file>.

*home* {0|1|2|...} | -1::
  With set, homes the indicated joint or, if -1, homes all joints.

*jog_stop* __joint_number__|__axis_letter__
  With set, stop any in-progress jog on the specified joint or axis.
  If TELEOP_ENABLE is OFF, use __joint_number__.  If TELEOP_ENABLE is ON, use __axis_letter__.

_jog joint_number_ | _axis_letter_ _<speed>_::
  With set, jog the specified joint or axis at <speed>; sign of speed is direction.
  If TELEOP_ENABLE is OFF, use joint_number; If TELEOP_ENABLE is ON, use axis_letter.

  With set, jog the indicated joint or axis by increment <incr> at the _<speed>_;
  sign of speed is direction. If TELEOP_ENABLE is OFF, use __joint_number__.
  If TELEOP_ENABLE is ON, use __axis_letter__.

*feed_override* _<percent>_::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current feed override is returned (as a percentage of commanded feed).
  With set, sets the feed override as specified.

*spindle_override* _<percent>_ {__<spindle>__}::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current spindle override is returned (as a percentage of commanded speed).
  With set, sets the spindle override as specified.
  If "spindle" is omitted, spindle 0 is selected. If -1, all spindles are selected.

*abs_cmd_pos* [{0|1|...}]::
  With get, returns the specified axis' commanded position in absolute coordinates.
  If no axis is specified, returns all axes' commanded absolute position.

*abs_act_pos* [{0|1|...}]::
  With get, returns the specified axis' actual position in absolute coordinates.
  If no axis is specified, returns all axes' actual absolute position.

*rel_cmd_pos* [{0|1|...}]::

  With set, sends _<string>_ as an MDI command.

*task_plan_init*::
  With set, initializes the program interpreter.

*open* _<filename>_::
  With set, opens the named file. The <filename> is opened by linuxcnc,
  so it should either be an absolute path or a relative path
  starting in the LinuxCNC working directory (the directory of the active INI file).

*run* [_<StartLine>_]::
  With set, runs the opened program. If no StartLine is specified, runs from the beginning.
  If a StartLine is specified, start line, runs from that line.
  A start line of -1 runs in verify mode.

  With get, returns the name of the currently opened program, or "none".

*program_line*::
  With get, returns the currently executing line of the program.

*program_status*::
  With get, returns "idle", "running", or "paused".

*program_codes*::
  With get, returns the string for the currently active program codes.

*joint_type* [_<joint>_]::
  With get, returns "linear", "angular", or "custom" for the type of the
  specified joint (or for all joints if none is specified).

*joint_units* [__<joint>__]::
  With get, returns "inch", "mm", "cm", or "deg", "rad", "grad", or "custom",
  for the corresponding native units of the specified joint (or for all joints if none is specified).
  The type of the axis (linear or angular) is used to resolve which type of units are returned.
  The units are obtained heuristically, based on the EMC_AXIS_STAT::units numerical value of user units per mm or deg.
  For linear joints, something close to 0.03937 is deemed "inch", 1.000 is "mm", 0.1 is "cm", otherwise it's "custom".
  For angular joints, something close to 1.000 is deemed "deg", PI/180 is "rad", 100/90 is "grad", otherwise it's "custom".

*program_units*::
  Synonym for program_linear_units.

*program_linear_units*::
  With get, returns "inch", "mm", "cm", or "none", for the corresponding
  linear units that are active in the program interpreter.

*program_angular_units*::
  With get, returns "deg", "rad", "grad", or "none" for the corresponding
  angular units that are active in the program interpreter.

*user_linear_units*::
  With get, returns "inch", "mm", "cm", or "custom", for the corresponding
  native user linear units of the LinuxCNC trajectory level. This is
  obtained heuristically, based on the EMC_TRAJ_STAT::linearUnits
  numerical value of user units per mm. Something close to 0.03937 is
  deemed "inch", 1.000 is "mm", 0.1 is "cm", otherwise it's "custom".

*user_angular_units*::
  Returns "deg", "rad", "grad", or "custom" for the corresponding native
  user angular units of the LinuxCNC trajectory level.
  Like with linear units, this is obtained heuristically.

*display_linear_units*::
  With get, returns "inch", "mm", "cm", or "custom",
  for the linear units that are active in the display.
  This is effectively the value of linearUnitConversion.

*display_angular_units*::
  With get, returns "deg", "rad", "grad", or "custom",
  for the angular units that are active in the display.
  This is effectively the value of angularUnitConversion.

*linear_unit_conversion* { inch | mm | cm | auto }::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the active unit conversion is returned.
  With set, sets the unit to be displayed.
  If it's "auto", the units to be displayed match the program units.

*angular_unit_conversion* { deg | rad | grad | auto }::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the active unit conversion is returned.
  With set, sets the units to be displayed.
  If it's "auto", the units to be displayed match the program units.

*probe_clear*::
  With set, clear the probe tripped flag.

*probe_tripped*::
  With get, return the probe state - has the probe tripped since the last clear?

*probe_value*::
  With get, return the current value of the probe signal.

*probe* _<x>_ _<y>_ _<z>_::
  With set, move toward a certain location. If the probe is tripped on the
  way stop motion, record the position and raise the probe tripped flag.

*teleop_enable* [ on | off ]::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current teleop mode is returned.
  With set, sets the teleop mode as specified.

*kinematics_type*::
  With get, returns the type of kinematics functions used (identity=1, serial=2, parallel=3, custom=4).

*override_limits* { on | off }::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the override_limits setting is returned.
  With set, the override_limits parameter is set as specified.
  If override_limits is on, disables end of travel hardware limits to allow jogging off of a limit.
  If parameters is off, then hardware limits are enabled.

*optional_stop* {0|1}::
  With get, any parameter is ignored and the current "optional stop on M1"
  setting is returned. With set, the setting is set as specified.

== Example Session

This section shows an example session to the local machine (*localhost*).
Bold items are typed by you, non-bold is machine output.
Default values are shown for --port _PORT_NUMBER_ (*5007*), --conectpw _PASSWORD_ (*EMC*), and --enablepw _PASSWORD_ (*EMCTOO*).

The user connects to linuxcncrsh, handshakes with the server (hello),
enables machine commanding from this session (set enable), brings the
machine out of E-stop (set estop off) and turns it on (set machine on),
homes all the axes, switches the machine to mdi mode, sends an MDI
G-code command, then disconnects and shuts down LinuxCNC.
