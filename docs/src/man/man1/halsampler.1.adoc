== NAME

halsampler - sample data from HAL in realtime

== SYNOPSIS

*halsampler* [_options_]

== DESCRIPTION

**sampler**(9) and *halsampler* are used together to sample HAL data in
real time and store it in a file. *sampler* is a realtime HAL component
that exports HAL pins and creates a FIFO in shared memory. It then
begins sampling data from the HAL and storing it to the FIFO.
*halsampler* is a non-realtime program that copies data from the FIFO to
stdout, where it can be redirected to a file or piped to some other program.

== OPTIONS

*-c* _CHAN_::
  instructs *halsampler* to read from FIFO _CHAN_. FIFOs are numbered
  from zero, and the default value is zero, so this option is not needed
  unless multiple FIFOs have been created.
*-n* _COUNT_::
  instructs *halsampler* to read _COUNT_ samples from the FIFO, then
  exit. If *-n* is not specified, *halsampler* will read continuously
  until it is killed.
*-t*::
  instructs *halsampler* to tag each line by printing the sample number
  in the first column.
_FILENAME_::
  instructs *halsampler* to write to _FILENAME_ instead of to stdout.

== USAGE

A FIFO must first be created by loading **sampler**(9) with *halcmd loadrt* or a *loadrt* command in a HAL file.
Then *halsampler* can be invoked to begin printing data from the FIFO to stdout.

Data is printed one line per sample. If *-t* was specified, the sample
number is printed first. The data follows, in the order that the pins
were defined in the config string. For example, if the *sampler* config
string was "ffbs" then a typical line of output (without *-t*) would
look like:

123.55 33.4 0 -12

*halsampler* prints data as fast as possible until the FIFO is empty,
then it retries at regular intervals, until it is either killed or has
printed _COUNT_ samples as requested by *-n*. Usually, but not always,
data printed by *halsampler* will be redirected to a file or piped to
some other program.

The FIFO size should be chosen to absorb samples captured during any
momentary disruptions in the flow of data, such as disk seeks, terminal
scrolling, or the processing limitations of subsequent program in a
pipeline. If the FIFO gets full and *sampler* is forced to overwrite old
data, *halsampler* will print 'overrun' on a line by itself to mark each
gap in the sampled data. If *-t* was specified, gaps in the sequential
sample numbers in the first column can be used to determine exactly how
many samples were lost.

The data format for *halsampler* output is the same as for **halstreamer**(1)
input, so 'waveforms' captured with *halsampler* can be replayed using *halstreamer*.
The *-t* option should not be used in this case.

== EXIT STATUS

If a problem is encountered during initialization, *halsampler* prints a
message to stderr and returns failure.

Upon printing _COUNT_ samples (if *-n* was specified) it will shut down
and return success. If it is terminated before printing the specified
number of samples, it returns failure. This means that when *-n* is not
specified, it will always return failure when terminated.
