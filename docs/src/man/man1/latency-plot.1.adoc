= latency-plot(1)

== NAME

latency-plot - another way to view latency numbers

== SYNOPSIS

*latency-plot* [ *-?* | *--help* ] [ *-H* | *--hal* ] [ *-b* | *--base* *_ns_* ] [ *-s* | *--servo* *_ns_* ] [ *-t* | *--time* *_ms_* ] [ *--relative* ] [ *--actual* ]

== DESCRIPTION

*latency-plot* makes a strip chart recording for a base and a servo thread.
It may be useful to see spikes in latency when other applications are started or used.
Mainly superseded by latency-histogram.

LinuxCNC and HAL should not be running, stop with _halrun -U_.

== OPTIONS

*-?*, *--help*::
  Show options and exit.
*-H*, *--hal*::
*-b*, *--base* _ns_::
  base thread interval in nanoseconds, default: 25000
*-s*, *--servo* _ns_::
  servo thread interval in nanoseconds, default: 1000000
*-t*, *--time* _ms_::
  report interval in milliseconds, default: 1000, min: 100, max: 10000
*--relative*::
  relative clock time (default)
*--actual*::
  actual clock time
