== NAME

halrmt - remote-control interface for LinuxCNC

== SYNOPSIS

*halrmt* [*--port* _<port number>_] [*--name* _<server name>_] [*--connectpw* _<password>_] [*--enablepw* _<password>_] [*--sessions* _<max sessions>_] [*-ini* _<INI file>_]

== OPTIONS

--port _port_:: Waits for socket connections (telnet) on specified
socket, without port specification it uses default port 5006.
(note: linuxcncrsh uses 5007 as default)
--name _server_name_:: Sets the server name to specified name for Hello.
--connectpw _password_:: Sets the connection password to 'password'. Default: EMC.
--enablepw _password_:: Sets the enable password to _password_. Default EMCTOO.
--sessions <max sessions>:: Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connextions to max sessions. Default is no limit (-1).
-ini _<INI file>_:: Uses the specified _INI file_ instead of the default emc.ini.

== DESCRIPTION

*halrmt* supports six commands of which the commands _set_ and _get_
contain HAL specific sub-commands based on the commands supported by
_halcmd_. Commands and most parameters are not case sensitive. The
exceptions are passwords, file paths and text strings. The supported
commands are as follows: *HELLO* Hello <password> <client> <version>

If a valid password was entered the server will respond with HELLO ACK
_Server Name>_ _<Server Version>_ where server name and server version are
looked up from the implementation. If an invalid password or any other
syntax error occurs then the server responds with: HELLO NAK

Get:: The get command includes one of the HAL sub-commands,
described below and zero or more additional parameters.
Set:: The set command inclides one of the HAL sub-commands,
described below and one or more additional parameters.
Quit:: The quit command disconnects the associated socket connection.
Shutdown:: The shutdown command tells LinuxCNC to shut down
before quitting the connection. This command may only be issued if the
Hello has been successfully negotiated and the connection has control of
the CNC (see enable sub-command below). This command has no parameters.
Help:: The help command will return help information in text format over the
telnet connection. If no parameters are specified, it will itemize the
available commands. If a command is specified, it will provide usage
information for the specified command. Help will respond regardless of
whether a "Hello" has been successfully negotiated.

*HAL sub-commands:*

echo on | off:: With get will return the current echo
state, with set, sets the echo state. When echo is on, all commands will
be echoed upon receipt. This state is local to each connection.

verbose on | off:: With get will return the current verbose state, with set, sets
the verbose state. When in verbose mode is on, all set commands return
positive acknowledgement in the form SET <COMMAND> ACK. In addition,
text error messages will be issued when in verbose mode. This state is
local to each connection.

enable <pwd> | off:: With get will return On or
Off to indicate whether the current connection is enabled to perform
control functions. With set and a valid password, the current connection
is enabled for control functions. "OFF" may not be used as a password
and disables control functions for this connection.

config [TBD] comm_mode ascii | binary:: With get, will return the current
communications mode. With set, will set the communications mode to the
specified mode. The binary protocol is TBD.

comm_prot <version no>:: With get, returns the current protocol version used by the server,
with set, sets the server to use the specified protocol version, provided it is
lower than or equal to the highest version number supported by the server implementation.

Comps [<substring>]::
Get only, returns all components beginning with the specified substring.
If no substring is specified then it returns all components.

Pins [<substring>]::
Get only, returns all information about all pins beginning with the
specified substring. If no substring is specified then it returns all
pins.

PinVals [<substring>]::
Get only, returns only value information about all pins beginning with
the specified substring. If no substring is specified then it returns
all pins.

Signals [<substring>]::
Get only, returns all information about all signals beginning with the
specified substring. If no substring is specified then it returns all
signals.

SigVals [<substring>]::
Get only, returns only value information about all signals beginning
with the specified substring. If no substring is specified then it
returns all pins.

Params [<substring>]::
Get only, returns all information about all parameters beginning with
the specified substring. If no substring is specified then it returns
all parameters.

ParamVals [<substring>]::
Get only, returns only value information about all parameters beginning
with the specified substring. If no substring is specified then it
returns all pins parameters.

Functs [<substring>]::
Get only, returns all information about all functions beginning with the
specified substring. If no substring is specified then it returns all
functions.
