== NAME

emccalib - Adjust ini tuning variables on the fly with save option

== SYNOPSIS

*emccalib.tcl* [_options_]


== DESCRIPTION

The Calibration assistant.  This tool Reads the HAL file and for every
'setp' that uses a variable from the INI file that is in an [AXIS_L],
[JOINT_N], [SPINDLE_S], or [TUNE] section it creates an entry that can
be edited and tested.

== USAGE

The calibration/tuning tool supports the following stanzas:

  [JOINT_N], [AXIS_L], [SPINDLE_S], [TUNE]

where _N_ is a joint number (0 .. ([KINS]JOINTS-1) ),
_L_ is an axis coordinate letter (X,Y,Z,A,B,C,U,V,W),
and _S_ is a spindle number (0 .. 9).

[NOTE]
The number of allowed spindles is 8 but legacy configurations
may include a stanza [SPINDLE_9] unrelated to an actual spindle number.

[NOTE]
The [TUNE] stanza may be used for specifying tunable items
not relevant to the other supported stanzas.

== EXIT STATUS

Return exit code 1 if the ini file is incompatible with the current
version of emccalib.
