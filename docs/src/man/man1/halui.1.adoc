= halui(1)

== NAME

halui - observe HAL pins and command LinuxCNC through NML

== SYNOPSIS

*halui* [*-ini* _<path-to-INI>_]

== DESCRIPTION

*halui* is used to build a User Interface using hardware knobs and switches.
It exports a big number of pins, and acts accordingly when these change.

== OPTIONS

*-ini* _filename_::
  Use the _filename_ as the configuration file. Note: halui must find
  the nml file specified in the INI, usually that file is in the same
  folder as the INI, so it makes sense to run halui from that folder.

== USAGE

When run, *halui* will export a large number of pins. A user can connect
those to his physical knobs & switches & leds, and when a change is
noticed halui triggers an appropriate event.

*halui* expects the signals to be debounced, so if needed (bad knob
contact) connect the physical button to a HAL debounce filter first.

*halui.max-velocity.increase* bit in::
  A positive edge (a False to True transition) on this pin increases the

  This pin controls the scale of changes to the max velocity. Each unit
  change in .counts, and each positive edge on .increase and .decrease,
