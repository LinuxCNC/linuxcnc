== NAME

xhc-hb04 - HAL non-realtime component for the xhc-hb04 pendant.

== DESCRIPTION

The xhc-hb04 component supports a common USB pendant that provides a
number of pushbuttons, a manual pulse generator (mpg or jog wheel), and
a selector switch for the wheel.

There are at least two hardware versions -- one with 16 buttons and a
more common one with 18 buttons. The information herein is based on the
18 button device with a USB Vendor:Product code of 10CE:EB70.

In addition to buttons, the pendant provides an LCD display for the
current stepsize multiplier (from a set of available integer values),
position (absolute and relative, labeled MC and WC respectively),
feedrate (override percent and value in units per minute), and spindle
speed (override percent and value in revolutions per minute (RPM)). The
display is managed by a rotary switch that selects one of four axes for
wheel positioning, feed override, spindle override, or OFF.

The pendant display, its rotary selector switch, and the component pin
names use designators x,y,z,a. While this arrangement presumes a machine
configured as XYZA, the pins can be assigned independently as required
in a HAL configuration.

== UDEV

The xhc-hb04 executable needs permission for reading the pendant's USB
device. Debian package installs (debs) handle this automatically but
Run-In-Place (RIP) builds may need a udev rules file. This file should
be created (using sudo and a text editor) as:

....
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-xhc-hb04.rules with the single line:

ATTR{idProduct}=="eb70", ATTR{idVendor}=="10ce", MODE="0666", OWNER="root", GROUP="plugdev"
....

== Standalone Usage

The xhc-hb04 program can be run from the command line without LinuxCNC
to test a pendant in a simulation mode. This standalone mode is used to
identify the button codes produced for each button press and to verify
proper counting of the jog wheel. The identified button codes can be
used to create a *button-cfg-file*. When a *button-cfg-file* exists,
pendant operation can be verified using the -I option to specify the
file.

Usage:

$ xhc-hb04 [options]

== Options

*-h*:: list command line options and exit
*-I button-cfg-file*:: see below for file format
*-H*:: run in real-time HAL mode (simulation mode is default)
*-x*:: wait for pendant detection before creating HAL pins.
*-s* _n_:: _n_ is one of the following stepsize sequences
+
1: 1,10,100,1000 (default)
2: 1,5,10,20 3: 1,10,100
4: 1,5,10,20,50,100
5: 1,10,50,100,1000
+
The stepsize selected is always multiplied by 0.001.

== button-cfg-file format

Standard configuration files are provided in the distribution for known
button configurations:

....
   /usr/share/linuxcnc/hallib/xhc-hb04-layout1.cfg
   /usr/share/linuxcnc/hallib/xhc-hb04-layout2.cfg
or for a RIP build:
   rip_base_dir/lib/hallib/xhc-hb04-layout1.cfg
   rip_base_dir/lib/hallib/xhc-hb04-layout2.cfg
....

layout1 describes the 16 button pendant, layout2 describes the more
common 18 button pendant.

The button configuration file follows the same format as INI files but
should use a file suffix of .cfg.

....
File format:
  [XHC-HB04]
  BUTTON=X1:button-thename1
  BUTTON=X2:button-thename2
  BUTTON=X3:button-thename3
  etc.
....

XN is the code reported for a button press and button-thenameN is the
name to be assigned to the pin created for the button.

== HAL Usage

Use the -H option to specify HAL mode and other options as required:

`loadusr -W` xhc-hb04 `-H` _[options]_

Example: `loadusr -W xhc-hb04-H -I` _path_to_cfg_file_ `-s 2`

== Input Pins (Control)

  A 1 pulse on this pin changes the stepsize to the next higher stepsize
  in the stepsize sequence specified in the xhc-hb04 (loadusr) command.

button is pressed AND the selector-switch is set to the corresponding
axis [xyza].

....
   (bit out) xhc-hb04.button-zero-[xyza]
   (bit out) xhc-hb04.button-goto-zero-[xyza]
   (bit out) xhc-hb04.button-half-[xyza]
....

== DEBUGGING

For debugging USB activity, use environmental variable LIBUSB_DEBUG:

export LIBUSB_DEBUG=[2 | 3 | 4]; xhc-hb04 [options]::
  2:warning, 3:info, 4:debug

== Sim Configs

The distribution includes several simulation configurations in the directory:

....
   /usr/share/doc/linuxcnc/examples/sample-configs/sim/axis/xhc-hb04/
or for a RIP build:
   rip_base_dir/configs/sim/axis/xhc-hb04/
....

These configurations use a distribution-provided script (xhc-hb04.tcl)
to configure the pendant and make necessary HAL connections according to
a number of INI file settings. The script uses an additional HAL
component (xhc_hb04_util) to provide common functionality and includes
support for a standard method for the start-pause button.

The settings available include: 1) specify button-cfg-file for standard
layout1 or layout2 2) select axes (up to 4 axes from set of x y z a b c
u v w) 3) implement per-axis filtering coefficients 4) implement
per-axis acceleration for mpg jogging 5) implement per-axis scale
settings 6) select normal or velocity based jog modes 7) select stepsize
sequence 8) option to initialize pin for inch or mm display icon 9)
option to require pendant on startup

The sim configs illustrate button connections that: 1) connect pendant
stepsize-up button to the step input pin. 2) connect buttons to halui.*
pins 3) connect buttons to motion.* pins

Another script is included to monitor the pendant and report loss of USB connectivity.
See the README and .txt files in the above directory for usage.

=== Note
The sim configs use the AXIS GUI but the scripts are available
with any HAL configuration or GUI. The same scripts can be used to adapt
the xhc-hb04 to existing configurations provided that the halui, motion,
and axis.N pins needed are not otherwise claimed. Instructions are
included in README file in the directory named above.

Use halcmd to display the pins and signals used by the xhc-hb04.tcl script:

....
  halcmd show pin xhc-hb04       (show all xhc-hb04 pins)
  halcmd show pin pendant_util   (show all pendant_util pins)
  halcmd show sig pendant:       (show all pendant signals)
....
