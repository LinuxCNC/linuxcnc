== NAME

halmeter - observe HAL pins, signals, and parameters

== SYNOPSIS

*halmeter* [*-s*] [**pin**|**sig**|**param** _name_] [*-g* _X-position Y-position_ [_Width_]]

== DESCRIPTION

*halmeter* is used to observe HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) pins,
signals, or parameters. It serves the same purpose as a multimeter does
when working on physical systems.

== OPTIONS

*pin* _name_::
  Display the HAL pin _name_.
*sig* _name_::
  Display the HAL signal _name_.
*param* _name_::
  Display the HAL parameter _name_.

If neither *pin*, *sig*, or *param* are specified,
the window starts out blank and the user must select an item to observe:

*-s*::
  Small window. Non-interactive, must be used with *pin*, *sig*, or
  *param* to select the item to display. The item name is displayed in
  the title bar instead of the window, and there are no "Select" or
  "Exit" buttons. Handy when you want a lot of meters in a small space.
*-g*::
  Geometry position. Allows one to specify the initial starting position
  and optionally the width of the meter. Referenced from top left of
  screen in pixel units. Handy when you want to load a lot of meters in
  a script with out them displaying on top of each other.

== USAGE

Unless *\-s* is specified, there are two buttons, "Select" and "Exit".
"Select" opens a dialog box to select the item (pin, signal, or
parameter) to be observed. "Exit" does what you expect.

The selection dialog has "OK", "Apply", and "Cancel" buttons. OK
displays the selected item and closes the dialog. "Apply" displays the
selected item but keeps the selection dialog open. "Cancel" closes the
dialog without changing the displayed item.

== EXAMPLE

*halmeter*::
  Opens a meter window, with nothing initially displayed. Use the
  "Select" button to choose an item to observe. Does not return until
  the window is closed.
*halmeter &*::
  Open a meter window, with nothing initially displayed. Use the
  "Select" button to choose an item. Runs in the background leaving the
  shell free for other commands.
*halmeter pin* _parport.0.pin-03-out_ *&*::
  Open a meter window, initially displaying HAL pin
  _parport.0.pin-03-out_. The "Select" button can be used to display
  other items. Runs in background.
*halmeter -s pin* _parport.0.pin-03-out_ *&*::
  Open a small meter window, displaying HAL pin _parport.0.pin-03-out_.
  The displayed item cannot be changed. Runs in background.
*halmeter -s pin* _parport.0.pin-03-out_ *-g* _100 500_ *&*::
  Open a small meter window, displaying HAL pin _parport.0.pin-03-out_.
  places it 100 pixels to the left and 500 pixels down from top of
  screen. The displayed item cannot be changed. Runs in background.
*halmeter -s pin* _parport.0.pin-03-out_ *-g* _100 500 400_ *&*::
  Open a small meter window, displaying HAL pin _parport.0.pin-03-out_.
  places it 100 pixels to the left and 500 pixels down from top of
  screen. The width will be 400 pixels (270 is default) The displayed
  item cannot be changed. Runs in background.
