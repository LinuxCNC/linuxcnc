= iov2(1)

== NAME

iov2 - interacts with HAL or G-code in non-realtime

== SYNOPSIS

*[EMCIO]* +
*EMCIO = iov2*

== DESCRIPTION

I/O control handles I/O tasks like coolant, toolchange and E-stop.
The signals are turned on and off in non-realtime with G-code or in the case
of E-stop in HAL.

I/O Control V2 (iov2) adds more toolchager support for communication with the toolchanger.

Whether *io* or *iov2* is used can be chosen in the [EMCIO] section of the INI file.

== Pins

=== Basic pins

*iocontrol.0.coolant-flood* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when flood coolant is requested.
*iocontrol.0.coolant-mist* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when mist coolant is requested.
*iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in* (Bit, In)::
  Should be driven FALSE when an external E-stop condition exists.
*iocontrol.0.tool-change* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when a tool change is requested.
*iocontrol.0.tool-changed* (Bit, In)::
  Should be driven TRUE when a tool change is completed.
*iocontrol.0.tool-number* (s32, Out)::
  Current tool number.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prep-number* (s32, Out)::
  The number of the next tool, from the RS274NGC T-word.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prep-pocket* (s32, Out)::
  This is the pocket number (location in the tool storage
  mechanism) of the tool requested by the most recent T-word.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prepare* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when a T__n__ tool prepare is requested.
*iocontrol.0.tool-prepared* (Bit, In)::
  Should be driven TRUE when a tool prepare is completed.
*iocontrol.0.user-enable-out* (Bit, Out)::
  FALSE when an internal E-stop condition exists.
*iocontrol.0.user-request-enable* (Bit, Out)::
  TRUE when the user has requested that E-stop be cleared.

=== Additional IO v2 pins

*iocontrol.0.emc-abort* (Bit, Out)::
  Signals emc-originated abort to toolchanger.
*iocontrol.0.emc-abort-ack* (Bit, In)::
  Acknowledge line from toolchanger for previous signal,
  or jumpered to abort-tool-change if not used in toolchanger.
  NB: after signaling an emc-abort, iov2 will block until emc-abort-ack is raised.
*iocontrol.0.emc-reason* (S32, Out)::
  Convey cause for EMC-originated abort to toolchanger.
  Usage: UI informational. Valid during emc-abort True.
*iocontrol.0.start-change* (Bit, Out)::
  Asserted at the very beginning of an M6 operation, before any spindle-off,
  quill-up, or move-to-toolchange-position operations are executed.
*iocontrol.0.start-change-ack* (Bit, In)::
  Acknowledgment line for start-change.
*iocontrol.0.toolchanger-fault* (Bit, In)::
  Toolchanger signals fault. This line is contionuously monitored.
  A fault toggles a flag in iocontrol which is reflected in the toolchanger-faulted pin.
*iocontrol.0.toolchanger-fault-ack* (Bit, Out)::
  Handshake line for above signal. Will be set by iov2 after
  above fault line True is recognized and deasserted when toolchanger-fault drops.
  Toolchanger is free to interpret the ack;
  reading the -ack lines assures fault has been received and acted upon.
*iocontrol.0.toolchanger-reason* (S32, In)::
  Convey reason code for toolchanger-originated fault to iov2.
*iocontrol.0.toolchanger-faulted* (Bit, Out)::
  Signals toolchanger-notify line has toggled and
  toolchanger-reason-code was in the fault range. Next M6 will abort.
*iocontrol.0.toolchanger-clear-fault* (Bit, In)::
  Resets TC fault condition. Deasserts toolchanger-faulted if toolchanger-notify is line False.
  Usage: UI - e.g. clear fault condition button.
*iocontrol.0.state* (S32, Out)::
  Debugging pin reflecting internal state.
