= haltcl(1)

== NAME

haltcl - manipulate the LinuxCNC HAL from the command line using a Tcl interpreter.

== SYNOPSIS

*haltcl* [*-i* _<INI file>_] [_filename_]

== DESCRIPTION

Tcl is a scripting language from the 90s that is very easy to extend.  *Haltcl*
extends the regular Tcl interpreter with a set of commands to interact with HAL, i.e.
it allows to manipulate the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) from
the command line using a Tcl interpreter. *haltcl* can optionally read
commands from a file (filename), allowing complex HAL configurations to
be set up with a single command.

== OPTIONS

*-i* _<INI file>_::
  If specified, the INI file is read and used to create Tcl global variable arrays.
  An array is created for each SECTION of the INI file with elements for each ITEM in the section.

For example, if the INI file contains:

----
[SECTION_A]
ITEM_1 = 1
[SECTION_A]
ITEM_2 = 2
[SECTION_B]
ITEM_1 = 10
----

The corresponding Tcl variables are:

----
SECTION_A(ITEM_1) = 1
SECTION_A(ITEM_2) = 2
SECTION_B(ITEM_1) = 10
----

*-ini* _<INI file>_ -- declining usage, use *-i* _<INI file>_::
*filename*::
  If specified, the Tcl commands of *filename* are executed. If no
  filename is specified, haltcl opens an interactive session.

== COMMANDS

The executable  *haltcl* includes the commands of a Tcl interpreter augmented with
commands for the hal language as described for *halcmd*(1).
The augmented commands can be listed with the command:

----
haltcl: hal --commands

addf alias delf delsig getp gets ptype stype help linkpp linkps linksp
list loadrt loadusr lock net newsig save setexact_for_test_suite_only
setp sets show source start status stop unalias unlinkp unload unloadrt
unloadusr unlock waitusr
----

Two of the augmented commands, 'list' and 'gets', require special
treatment to avoid conflict with Tcl built-in commands having the same
names. To use these commands, precede them with the keyword 'hal':

----
hal list
hal gets
