== NAME

mdro - manual only Digital Read Out (DRO)

== SYNOPSIS

*mdro* [*-v*] [*-p* _point_size_] [*-m*] [*-l* _file.var_] [_axes_]

== DESCRIPTION

*mdro* is a manual only DRO providing functionality similar to a
traditional manual DRO. It is most useful for manual machines converted
to CNC. It allows the user to manually control the machine while
continuing to use the DRO scales on the axes. The GUI can be sized to
match the user's screen. It is mouse-only and touchscreen friendly.

== OPTIONS

These command line options are normally used when *mdro* is started in a
HAL file. See below for the corresponding .ini file options.

*v*::
  Turn on verbose debug prints. *-vv* is even more verbose.
*p* _point_size_::
  Set the point size for the text in the application. This option
  controls the overall size of the window on the screen. Default is 20.
  Typical values range from 20 to 30.
*m*::
  Set this if the DRO scales provide data scaled in millimeters.
*l* _file.var_::
  Load G54 through G57 coordinates from _file.var_.
_axes_::
  This option is used to specify the names of the axes handled by the
  program. The default is "XYZ". A four axis mill would use "XYZA", and
  a lathe with a two axis DRO might use "XZ".

== SCREEN CONFIGURATION

The top of the screen includes a row for each axis specified in _axes_.
Data in these rows are derived from signals on the _mdro.axis.n_ pins
that are instantiated when *mdro* is started. Each row includes buttons
that allow the value to be be zeroed, to be halved or a new value to be
entered. There is also a button that enables the index zero process for
that axis.

The screen includes buttons that allow the selection of one of four
different coordinate systems. The machine coordinate system can also be
selected though it cannot be changed.

The screen includes a keypad that can be used with a mouse or a touch
screen to enter coordinate data.

Finally, buttons on the screen allow the selection of inch or mm data
display.

== USAGE

*mdro* is normally started from the _[DISPLAY]_ entry in a dedicated
*mdro.ini* file. The INI file and the associated HAL files should
include the pins and signals that support the DRO scales. The HAL
connections to *mdro* must be done in the _POSTGUI_HALFILE_ referenced
in the INI file.

Other _[DISPLAY]_ section options:::
_GEOMETRY_ = _axes_::
  Names the coordinate axes used in the program. For example, "XYZ" for
  a 3 axis mill or "XZ" for a lathe, Default is "XYZ".
_MDRO_VAR_FILE_ = _file.var_::
  Preload a VAR file. This is typically the VAR file used by the
  operational code.
_POINT_SIZE_ = _n_::
  This option sets the size of the font used which sets the overall size
  of the window. The default point size is 20, Typical sizes are 20 to
  30.
_MM_ = _1_::
  Set this if the DRO scales provide data scaled in millimeters.

== EXAMPLE

Using an example of "XYZA" for an _axes_ argument, these pins will be
created when *mdro* starts:

mdro.axis.0 mdro.axis.1 mdro.axis.2 mdro.axis.3 mdro.index-enable.0
mdro.index-enable.1 mdro.index-enable.2 mdro.index-enable.3

In this example, the first row will be labeled "X" and will show the
data associated with pin mdro.axis.0. In many configurations,
mdro.axis.0 can be connected directly to x-pos-fb in the POSTGUI-HAL
file. The index pins should be connected to the corresponding
index-enable pins from the DRO.

*mdro* can also be started via a "loadusr" command in a HAL file for a
trial. Here's an example of a sim setup:

loadusr -W mdro -l sim.var XYZ net x-pos-fb => mdro.axis.0 net y-pos-fb
=> mdro.axis.1 net z-pos-fb => mdro.axis.2
