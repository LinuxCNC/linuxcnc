== NAME

hy_vfd - HAL non-realtime component for Huanyang VFDs

== SYNOPSIS

*hy_vfd* [OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION

This component connects the Huanyang VFD to the LinuxCNC HAL via a
serial (RS-485) connection.

The Huanyang VFD must be configured via the face plate user interface to
accept serial communications:

PD001 = 2::
  Set register PD001 (source of run commands) to 2 (communication port).

PD002 = 2::
  Set register PD002 (source of operating frequency) to 2 (communication port).

PD004::
  Set register PD004 (Base Frequency) according to motor specs. This is
  the rated frequency of the motor from the motor's name plate, in Hz.

PD005::
  Set register PD005 (max frequency) according to motor specs. This is
  the maximum frequency of the motor's power supply, in Hz.

PD011::
  Set register PD011 (min frequency) according to motor specs. This is
  the minimum frequency of the motor's power supply, in Hz.

PD141::
  Set register PD141 (rated motor voltage) according to motor name
  plate. This is the motor's maximum voltage, in Volts.

PD142::
  Set register PD142 (rated motor current) according to motor name
  plate. This is the motor's maximum current, in Ampere.

PD143::
  Set register PD143 (Number of Motor Poles) according to motor name plate.

PD144::
  Set register PD144 (rated motor revolutions) according to motor name
  plate. This is the motor's speed in RPM at 50 Hz. Note: This is not
  the motor's max speed (unless the max motor frequency happens to be 50 Hz)!

PD163 = 1::
  Set register PD163 (communication address) to 1. This matches the
  default in the hy_vfd driver, change this if your setup has special needs.

PD164 = 2::
  Set register PD164 (baud rate) to 2 (19200 bps). This matches the
  default in the hy_vfd driver, change this if your setup has special needs.

PD165 = 3::
  Set register PD165 (communication data method) to 3 (8n1 RTU). This
  matches the default in the hy_vfd driver, change this if your setup
  has special needs. Note that the hy_vfd driver only supports RTU
  communication, not ASCII.

Consult the Huanyang instruction manual for details on using the face
plate to program the VFDs registers, and alternative values for the
above registers.

Access to devices such as /dev/ttyUSB0 is restricted to members of the
"dialout" group. If you see error messages such as +
*open: Permission denied* +
*ERROR Can't open the device /dev/ttyUSB0 (errno 13)* +
Check your groups membership with the command +
*groups* +
Then add your user to the dialout group with +
*sudo addgroup your-username dialout* +
You will need to log out and back in again for this to take effect.

== OPTIONS

-d, --device _<path>_::
  Set the name of the serial device node to use (defaults to /dev/ttyS0).

-g, --debug::
  Turn on debug messages. Note that if there are serial errors, this may
  become annoying. Debug mode will cause all serial communication
  messages to be printed in hex on the terminal.

-y, --regdump::
  Print the current value of all registers as soon as the VFD is enabled.

-n, --name _string_::
  Sets the name of the HAL module.
  The HAL comp name will be set to _string_, and all pin and parameter names will begin with _string_ (defaults to hy_vfd).

-b, --bits _n_::
  Set number of data bits to _n_, where n must be from 5 to 8 inclusive.
  This must match the setting in register PD165 of the Huanyang VFD (defaults to 8).

-p, --parity [even,odd,none]::
  Set serial parity to even, odd, or none. This must match
  the setting in register PD165 of the Huanyang VFD (default odd).

-r, --rate _n_::
  Set baud rate to _n_. It is an error if the rate is
  not one of the following: 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
  19200, 38400, 57600, 115200. This must match the setting in register
  PD164 of the Huanyang VFD (defaults to 38400).

-s, --stopbits [1,2]::
  Set serial stop bits to 1 or 2. This must match the
  setting in register PD165 of the HuanyangVFD (defaults to 1).

-t, --target _n_::
  Set HYCOMM target (slave) number. This must match the device number
  you set on the Hyanyang VFD in register PD163 (defaults to 1).

-F, --max-frequency _n_::
  If specified, program register PD005 of the
  VFD with the specified max frequency of _n_ Hz (and use the same max
  frequency in the hy_vfd driver). If not specified, read the max
  frequency to use from register PD005 of the VFD (default: read from VFD).

-f, --min-frequency _n_::
  If specified, program register PD011 of the VFD with the specified minimum frequency
  of <n> Hz (and use the same minimum frequency in the hy_vfd driver).
  If not specified, read the minimum frequency to use from register PD011 of the VFD (default: read from VFD).

-V, --motor-voltage _n_::
  If specified, program register PD141 of the VFD with the specified max motor voltage of _n_ Volts.
  If not specified, read the max motor voltage from register PD141 of the VFD (default: read from VFD).

-I, --motor-current _n_::
  If specified, program register PD142 of the VFD with the specified max motor current of _n_ Amps.
  If not specified, read the max motor current from register PD142 of the VFD (default: read from VFD).

-S, --motor-speed _n_::
  (default: compute from value read from VFD P144) This command-line
  argument is the motor's max speed. If specified, compute the motor's
  speed at 50 Hz from this argument and from the motor's max frequency
  (from the --max-frequency argument or from P011 if --max-frequency is
  not specified) and program register PD144 of the VFD. If not
  specified, read the motor's speed at 50 Hz from register P144 of the
  VFD, and use that and the max frequency to compute the motor's max speed.

-P, --motor-poles _n_::
  (default: read value from VFD P143) This command-line argument is the
  number of poles in the motor. If specified, this value is sent to the
  VFD's register PD143. If not specified, the value is read from PD143
  and reported on the corresponding HAL pin.

-x, --register PD__nnn__=__mmm__ _n_::
  Set a specific register to a new value. Can be used to set up to 10
  registers. Parameters will "stick" (but only after hy_vfd.enable has
  been set true) so to set more than ten parameters it is possible to
  repeatedly load the driver with a set of registers to set then enable
  (setp hy_vfd.enable 1) and unload (unload hy_vfd) the driver at a
  halrun(1) prompt. For example: +
  `loadusr -W hy_vfd -d /ttyUSB0 --register PD014=30 --register PD015=30`
  +
  Will set both ramp1 times to 3 seconds. The values should be scaled
  according to the manual data. The example above uses values with a
  resolution of 0.1 seconds, so the numbers are 10x larger than the
  required value.
