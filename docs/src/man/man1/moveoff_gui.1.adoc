== NAME

moveoff_gui - a GUI for the moveoff component

== SYNOPSIS

*moveoff_gui* [*--help* | -- *-h* | *-?]

*moveoff_gui* [_options_]

== DESCRIPTION

Moveoff_gui is a sample graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling a
HAL moveoff component to implement HAL-only offsets.
See the manpage (man moveoff) for *IMPORTANT* limitations and warnings.

Supported configurations must use a known kinematics module with
`KINEMATICS_TYPE = KINEMATICS_IDENTITY`.
The modules currently supported are: *trivkins*

== OPTIONS

*--help | -? | -- -h*::
  Show options and exit.
*-mode* *onpause* | always::
  onpause: popup GUI to control offsets when program paused +
  always: show GUI to control offsets always +
  Default: *onpause*
*-axes* _axis-names_::
  Letters from set of \{x y z a b c u v w}. +
  Examples: -axes x, -axes xyz, -axes xz (no spaces) +
  Default: *xyz*
*-inc* _incrementvalue_::
  Specify one increment value per -inc (up to 4). +
  Defaults: * 0.001 0.01 0.10 1.0*
*-size* _integer_::
  Overall gui size is based on font size, typically 8 - 20. +
  Default: *14*
*-loc* center | +x+y::
  Initial location on screen. +
  Examples: -loc center, -loc +20+100 +
  Default: *center*
*-autoresume*::
  Resume program when move-enable deasserted. +
  Default: notused
*-delay* _delay secs_::
  Delay for autoresume (allow time to restore spindle speed etc). +
  Default: *5*

== OTHER OPTIONS

These options are available for special cases:

*-noentry*::
  Disables creation of entry widgets. +
  Default: notused
*-no_resume_inhibit*::
  Disable use of resume-inhibit to controlling gui. +
  Default: notused
*-no_pause_requirement*::
  Disable check for halui.program.is-paused. +
  Default: notused
*-no_cancel_autoresume*::
  Useful for retracting offsets with simple external controls. +
  Default: notused
*-no_display*::
  Use when both external controls and external displays are in use. +
  Default: notused

== NOTES

LinuxCNC must be running.

Halui must be loaded, typical INI file setting:
----
[HAL]
HALUI = halui
----

The moveoff component must be loaded with the name 'mv' as: +
**loadrt moveoff names=**_mv **personality=**_number_of_axes_

If the pin mv.motion-enable is *not* connected when moveoff_gui is started,
*controls will be provided* to enable offsets and set offset values.
If the pin *is* connected, *only a display* of offsets is shown
and control must be made by *external* HAL connections.

If a pin named `*.resume-inhibit` exists and is not connected, it will be set while offsets are applied.
This pin may be provided by the controlling LinuxCNC GUI in use.
Use of the pin may be disabled with the option -no_resume_inhibit.

The -autoresume option uses `halui.program.resume` to automatically resume
program execution when the move-enable pin is deactivated and all offsets are removed.
The resume pin is not activated until an additional interval (-delay delay_secs) elapses.
This delay interval may be useful for restarting related equipment (a spindle motor for example).
While timing the delay, a popup is offered to cancel the automatic program resumption.

== USAGE

The INI file in the configuration directory must provide HALFILEs to
loadrt the moveoff component, connect its pins, and addf its read and
write functions in the proper order. These steps can be done at runtime
using an existing configuration INI file and specifying a system library
HALFILE *hookup_moveoff.tcl* as illustrated below:

----
[HAL]
HALUI = halui
HALFILE = user_halfile_1
etc ...
HALFILE = user_halfile_n
HALFILE = LIB:hookup_moveoff.tcl
----

The `hookup_moveoff.tcl` HAL file will use INI file settings for the moveoff component control pins:

----
[OFFSET]
EPSILON =
WAYPOINT_SAMPLE_SECS =
WAYPOINT_THRESHOLD =
BACKTRACK_ENABLE =
----

The *hookup_moveoff.tcl* will use INI file settings for the moveoff per-axis limits:

----
[AXIS_m]
OFFSET_MAX_VELOCITY =
OFFSET_MAX_ACCELERATION =
OFFSET_MAX_LIMIT =
OFFSET_MIN_LIMIT =
----

The moveoff_gui program should be specified in the APPLICATIONS stanza of the INI file, for example:

----
[APPLICATIONS]
DELAY = delay_in_secs_to_allow_hal_connections
APP = moveoff_gui -option1 -option2 ...
----

Simulation configurations that demonstrate the moveoff_gui and the
moveoff component are located in:
