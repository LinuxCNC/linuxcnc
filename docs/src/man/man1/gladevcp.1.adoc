== NAME

gladevcp - Virtual Control Panel for LinuxCNC based on Glade, Gtk and
HAL widgets

== SYNOPSIS

*gladevcp* [*-g* _WxH+X+Y_] [*-c* _component-name_] [*-u* _handler_] [*-U* _useroption_] [*-H* _HAL-file_] [*-d*] _myfile.ui_

== OPTIONS

*-g* _WxH+X+Y_::
  This sets the initial geometry of the root window. Use 'WxH' for just
  size, '+X+Y' for just position, or 'WxH+X+Y' for both. Size / position
  use pixel units. Position is referenced from top left.
*-c* _component-name_::
  Use _component-name_ as the HAL component name. If the component name
  is not specified, the basename of the UI file is used.
*-u* _handler_::
  Instructs GladeVCP to inspect the Python script _handler_ for event
  handlers, and connect them to signals in the UI file.
*-U* _useroption_::
  GladeVCP collects all _useroption_ strings and passes them to the
  handler init() method as a list of strings without further inspection.
*-x* _XID_::
  Reparent GladeVCP into an existing window _XID_ instead of creating a
  new top level window.
*-H* _halfile_::
  GladeVCP runs _HAL file_ - a list of HAL commands - by executing
  _halcmd -c filename_ after the HAL component is finalized.
*-d*::
  enable debug output.
*-R* _gtkrcfile_::
  explicitly load a gtkrc file.
*-t* _THEME_::
  set gtk theme. Default is the _system_ theme.
  Different panels can have different themes.
*-m* _MAXIMUM_::
  force panel window to maximize. Together with the _-g geometry_ option
  one can move the panel to a second monitor and force it to use all of
  the screen
*-R*::
  explicitly deactivate workaround for a GTK bug which makes matches of
  widget and widget_class matches in GTK theme and gtkrc files fail.
  Normally not needed.
