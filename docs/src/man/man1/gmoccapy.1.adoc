== NAME

gmoccapy - TOUCHY LinuxCNC Graphical User Interface

== SYNOPSIS

*gmoccapy* _-ini_ _<INI file>_

== DESCRIPTION

*GMOCCAPY* is one of the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for LinuxCNC.
It gets run by the runscript usually.

== OPTIONS

*INI file*::
  The _INI file_ is the main piece of an LinuxCNC configuration. It is
  not the entire configuration; there are various other files that go
  with it (NML files, HAL files, TBL files, VAR files). It is, however,
  the most important one, because it is the file that holds the
  configuration together. It can adjust a lot of parameters itself, but
  it also tells *LinuxCNC* which other files to load and use.

== SEE ALSO

Much more information about LinuxCNC and HAL is available in the
LinuxCNC and HAL User Manuals, found at /usr/share/doc/LinuxCNC/.
