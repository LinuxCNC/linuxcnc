*`Qtscreen`* uses _QtVCP widgets_ for LinuxCNC integration.

*Widget* is the general name for the _UI objects_ such as buttons and
labels in PyQt.

You are free to use any available *default widgets* in the _Qt Designer_ editor.

There are also *special widgets* made for LinuxCNC that make integration easier.
These are split in two, heading on the right side of the editor:

* One is for *HAL only widgets*.
* The other is for *CNC control widgets*.

You are free to mix them in any way on your panel.

[NOTE]
This description of widget properties can easily be out of date due to further development and lack of people to write docs (a good way to give back to the project).
The definitive descriptions are found by looking in the https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/tree/master/lib/python/qtvcp/widgets[source code].

Round Gauge can be used in a LinuxCNC GUI to *display an input parameter* on the dial face.

.Customizable Parameters
There are several properties that are user settable in order to customize the _appearance of the gauge_.

The following parameters can be set either programmatically or via the Qt Designer property editor.

*`halpin_option`*::
  Setting this to `True` will _create 2 HAL pins_:
  ** One is for setting the `value` input

.Non Customizable Parameters
There are 2 inputs that are not customizable.
They can be set via HAL pins, programmatically or via signals from other widgets:

*`value`*::
  This is the _actual input value_ that will be displayed with the gauge needle and in the digital readout. +
  It must be set to a value between 0 and `max_value` maximum value.
*`setpoint`*::
  This is a value that determines the location of a small _marker on the gauge face_.
  It must be set to a value between 0 and the maximum value.

The `DROLabel` widget holds a property *`isHomed`* that can be used with a stylesheet to change the _color of the `DRO_Label`
based on homing state of the joint_ number in LinuxCNC.

Here is a sample stylesheet entry that:

* Sets the font of all `DRO_Label` widgets,
* Sets the text template (to set resolution) of the DRO,
* Then sets the text color based on the Qt `isHomed` property.
* show all the menu options.

In the properties section notice that:

* `watch_axis_homed` is checked
* `axis_letter` is set to Z

If you double click the `image_list` a dialog will show and allow you to add image paths to.

If you have one image as an icon and one _clear image_ then that will look like it shows and _hides the icon_.

Selecting image paths can be done by selecting the `pixmap` property and selecting an image.

NOTE: The `pixmap` setting is for test display only and will be ignored outside of Qt Designer.

* Right click the image name and you should see 'Copy path'.
* Click 'Copy path'.
* Now double click the 'image list' property so the dialog shows.
* Click the 'New' button.
* Paste the image path in the entry box.

Do that again for the next image. +
_Use a clear image to represent a hidden icon._

You can _test the images display_ from the image list by changing the `image number`.
In this case `0` is unhomed and `1` would be homed. +
This is for test display only and will be ignored outside of Qt Designer.

.Setting Properties Programmatically
The screen designer chooses the *default settings of the `screenOptions` widget*.

Once chosen, most won't ever need to be changed.
But if needed, some can be changed in the handler file or in stylesheets.

* *In the handler file*: +
  Here we reference the widget by the Qt Designer user defined name:
+
[source,python]
----
# red,green,blue,alpha 0-255
color = QtGui.QColor(0, 255, 0, 191)
self.w.screen_options.setProperty('close_overlay_color', color)
self.w.screen_options.setProperty('play_sounds_option',False)
----

* *In style sheets*: +
  Here we can reference the widget by Qt Designer user defined name or by widget class name.
+
[source,{css}]
----
/* red, green, blue 0-255, alpha 0-100% or 0.0 to 1.0 */
/* the # sign is used to refer to Qt Designer defined widget name */
/* matches/applied to only this named widget */
#screen_options {
  qproperty-close_overlay_color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.75)
}
----

*Some settings are only checked on startup* so will not cause changes after startup.
In these cases you would need to _make the changes in Qt Designer only_.

.Preference File Entries

If the _preference file option is selected_, `screenOption` widget will make an *INI based preference file*.

=== `MacroTab` - Special Macros Widget

.QtVCP `MacroTab`: Special Macros Widget
image::images/qtvcp_macro.png["QtVCP MacroTab: Special Macros Widget",scale="25%"]

This widget allows a user to *select and adjust special macro programs* for doing small jobs.

It uses _images for visual representation_ of the macro and for an icon.

It searches for special macros using the _INI definition_:

[source,{ini}]
----
[RS274NGC]
SUBROUTINE_PATH =
----

The macros are *`O-word` subroutines with special comments* to work with the launcher.
The first three lines _must_ have the keywords below, the fourth is optional.

Here is a sample for the first four lines in an _O-word file_:

[source,{ini}]
----
; MACROCOMMAND = Entry1,Entry2
; MACRODEFAULTS = 0,true
; MACROIMAGE = my_image.svg,Icon layer number,Macro layer number
; MACROOPTIONS = load:yes,save:yes,default:default.txt,path:~/macros
----

.`MACROCOMMAND`

This is the _first line_ in the O-word file.

It is a *comma separated list of text to display above an entry*. +
There will be *one for every variable required* in the O-word function.

If the macro does not require variables, leave it empty:

[source,{ini}]
----
; MACROCOMMAND=
----

.`MACRODEFAULTS`

This must be the _second line_ in the O-word file.

It is a *comma separated list of the default values for each variable* in the O-word function.

If you use the word `true` or `false` in the list, a `*checkbutton*` will be shown.

.`MACROIMAGE`

This must be the _third line_ in the O-word file.

* *SVG Images* +
  If using SVG image files, they must end with the `.svg` extension. +
+
The images must be added to _SVG layers_ which are used to define the different images for macro and icon.
+
Value is comma separated list of three ordered fields:
+
[source,{ini}]
----
; MACROIMAGE=filename.svg,macro_layer_name[,icon_layer_name]
----
+
With:
+
*`_filename_.svg`*::
  SVG image file name as first field. +
  It is assumed to be in the same folder as the O-word file.
*`*macro_layer_name`*::
  Macro image layer name as second field.
*`icon_layer_name`*::
  Icon image layer name as optional third field.
  If the third entry is missing, the same image will be used for macro and icon.
* *PNG/JPG Images*: +
  Value remains a comma separated list:
+
[source,{ini}]
----
; MACROIMAGE=macro_image.(png|jpg)[,icon_image.(png|jpg)]
----
+
With:
+
*`_macro_image_.(png|jpg)`*::
  Macro image file name as first field. +
  It is assumed that the image file are in the same folder than the macro.
*`_icon_image_.(png|jpg)`*::

  If the second entry is missing the same image will be used for macro and image.

If the keyword is present but the entries are missing, no images will be used.

.`MACROOPTIONS`

This _optional line must be the fourth_ line in the O-word file.

It is a comma separated list of keyword and data:

*`LOAD:yes`*::
  Shows a load button.
 *`SAVE:yes`*::
  Shows a save button.

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:mdiline]]
=== `MDILine` - MDI Commands Line Entry Widget

  An error will result if the command is unsuccessful.
  * _Syntax_: `net <signal name> <pin name>`
  * __Example__: `net plasmac:jog-inhibit motion.jog-stop`
*`setp`*::
  _Sets the value of a pin or a parameter_. +
  Valid values depend on the object type of the pin or parameter. +
  It results in an error if the data types do not match or the pin is connected to a signal.
  * _Syntax_: `setp <pin/parameter-name> <value>`
  * _Example_: `setp plasmac.resolution 100`
*`unlinkp`*::
  _Disconnects a pin from a signal_. +
  An error will result if the pin does not exist. +
  Running LinuxCNC from terminal may help determine the root cause as error messages from `hal_lib.c` will be displayed there.
  * _Syntax_: `unlinkp <pin name>`
  * __Example__: `unlinkp motion.jog-stop`

NOTE: The `MDILine` function *`spindle_inhibit`* can be used by a GUI's handler file to inhibit `M3`, `M4`, and `M5` spindle commands if necessary.

It is based on PyQt's _QLineEdit_.

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:mdihistory]]
=== `MDIHistory` - MDI Commands History Widget

//TODO MDIHistory widget capture
//TODO Merge MDILine and MDIHistory sections ?

Displays a *scrollable list of past MDI command*.

An edit line is embedded for MDI commands.
The same MDILine embedded commands may be accessed from this widget.

[source,{ini}]
----
MDI_HISTORY_FILE = '~/.axis_mdi_history'
----

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:mditouchy]]
=== `MDITouchy` - Touch Screen MDI Entry Widget

.QtVCP `MDITouchy`: Touch Screen MDI Entry Widget
image::images/qtvcp_mdiTouchy.png["QtVCP MDITouchy: Touch Screen MDI Entry Widget",scale="25%"]

This widget displays *buttons and entry lines to use for entering MDI commands*.

Based on LinuxCNC's Touchy screen's MDI entry process, its large buttons are most useful for touch screens.

To use `MDITouchy`:

* First press one of the `G/XY`, `G/RO`, `M` or `T` button.
  On the left will show the entry fields that can be filled out.
* Then press `Next` and `Back` to navigate between fields.
* `Calc` will pop up a calculator dialog.
* `Clear` clears the current entry.
* `Set Tool` will call for a tool change.
* `Set Origin` will allow setting the origin of the current G6x system.
* `Macro` will call any available macro ngc programs.

The widget _requires an explicit call to MDITouchy Python code_ to _actually run the MDI command_:

* *For handler file code* +
  If the widget was named 'mditouchy' in Qt Designer, the command below would run the displayed MDI command:
+
[source,python]
----
self.w.mditouchy.run_command()
----

* *For action button use* +
  If the widget was named 'mditouchy' in Qt Designer, use the action button's 'Call Python commands' option and enter:
+
[source,python]
----
INSTANCE.mditouchy.run_command()
----

The macro button _cycles though macros defined in the INI [DISPLAY] heading_.

Add one or more `MACRO` lines of the following format:

[source,{ini}]
----
MACRO = macro_name [param1] [... paramN]
----

In the example below, `increment` is the name of the macro, and it accepts two parameters, named `xinc` and `yinc`.

[source,{ini}]
----
MACRO = incerment xinc yinc
----

Now, place the macro in a file named `macro_name.ngc` in the `PROGRAM_PREFIX` directory,
or into any directory in the `SUBROUTINE_PATH` specified in the INI file.

Keeping on with the example above, it would be named `increment.ngc` and its content could look like:

[source,{ngc}]
----
O<increment> sub
G91 G0 X#1 Y#2
G90
O<increment> endsub
----

Notice the _name of the sub matches the file name and macro name exactly_, including case.

When you invoke the macro by pressing the Macro button you can enter values for parameters (`xinc` and `yinc` in our example). +
These are passed to the macro as positional parameters: `#1`, `#2`...  `#N` respectively. +
Parameters you leave empty are passed as value `0`.

If there are several different macros, press the Macro button repeatedly to cycle through them.

In this simple example, if you enter -1 for xinc and invoke the running of the MDI cycle,
a rapid 'G0' move will be invoked, moving one unit to the left.

This macro capability is useful for edge/hole probing and other setup tasks,
as well as perhaps hole milling or other simple operations that can be done from the panel without requiring specially-written G-code programs.

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:originoffsetview]]

[[sec:qtvcp:widgets:dialog]]
== Dialog Widgets

Dialogs are used to *present or request immediately required information* in a focused way.

The typical used dialogs can be loaded using the `ScreenOptions` _widget_.

You can also add them directly to the _UI_ - but each dialog must have a unique launch name or you will see multiple dialogs displayed, one after another.

.Use dialogs from Python Code
You can show dialogs directly with _Python code_, but a safer way is to *use `STATUS` messages* to request the dialog to launch and to return the gathered information.

* *Register to `STATUS` channel*: +
  To set this up, first register to catch the `general` message from `STATUS`:
+
[source,python]
----
STATUS.connect('general',self.return_value)
----

* *Add a function to call a dialog*: +
  This function must _build a message `dict` to send to the dialog_. +
  This message will be passed back in the general message with the addition of the _`return` variable_. +
  It is possible to add _extra user information_ to the message.
  The dialog will ignore these and pass them back.
  `NAME`:: Launches code name of dialog to show.
  `ID`:: A unique id so we process only a dialog that we requested.
  `TITLE`:: The title to use on the dialog.

+
[source,python]
----
def show_dialog(self):
    mess = {'NAME':'ENTRY','ID':'__test1__',
            'TITLE':'Test Entry'}
    ACTION.CALL_DIALOG, mess)
----

* *Add a callback function that processes the general message*: +
  Keep in mind this function will _get all general messages_ so the `dict` keynames are not guaranteed to be there.
  Using the `.get()` function and/or using `try`/`except` is advisable.
  This function should:
  ** check the name and id is the same as we sent,
  ** then extract the return value and any user variables.

+
[source,python]
----
# process the STATUS return message
def return_value(self, w, message):
    rtn = message.get('RETURN')
    code = bool(message.get('ID') == '__test1__')
    name = bool(message.get('NAME') == 'ENTRY')
    if code and name and not rtn is None:
        print('Entry return value from {} = {}'.format(code, rtn))

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:nurbseditor]]
=== `NurbsEditor` - NURBS Editing Widget

.QtVCP `NurbsEditor`: NURBS Editing Widget
image::images/qtvcp_nurbsEditor.png["QtVCP NurbsEditor: NURBS Editing Widget",scale="25%"]

The Nurbs editor allows you to *manipulate a NURBS based geometry* on screen and then *convert NURBS to G-code*.

It is based on PyQt's _QDialog_.

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:joypad]]
=== `JoyPad` - 5 button D-pad Widget

//TODO JoyPad widget capture

It is the base class for the `HALPad` widget.

This widget looks and acts like a *5 button D-pad, with a LED like indicators in a ring*.

You can put text or icons in each of the button positions.

You can _connect to output signals_ when the buttons are pressed.

There are also _input slots_ to change the color of the indicator(s).

.ENUMS
There are *enumerated constants used to reference indicator positions*. +
They are used in Qt Designer editor's property editor or in Python code.

*`NONE`*::
*`LEFT`, `L`*::
*`RIGHT`, `R`*::
*`CENTER`, `C`*::
*`TOP`, `T`*::
*`BOTTOM`, `B`*::
*`LEFTRIGHT`, `X`*::
*`TOPBOTTOM`, `A`*::

For Python handler code, you use the widget name in Qt Designer plus the reference constant:

[source,python]
----
self.w.joypadname.set_highlight(self.w.joypadname.LEFT)
----

.Useful Override-able Functions

[source,python]
----
def _pressedOutput(self, btncode):
    self.joy_btn_pressed.emit(btncode)
    self[''.format(btncode.lower())].emit(True)

def _releasedOutput(self, btncode):
    self.joy_btn_released.emit(btncode)
    self['joy_{}_pressed'.format(btncode.lower())].emit(False)
----

As coded these function _issue (emit) PyQt5 signals (joy_btn_pressed and joy_<letter>_pressed) for the any button pressed or released_.

Signal 'joy_btn_pressed' outputs a string code for the button. +
Signal 'joy_<letter>_pressed' outputs a bool value.

You could override the functions to do something else if making a custom widget:

.Callable Functions
*`reset_highlight()`*::
  Clears the highlight indicator.
*`set_highlight(_button_, state=_True_)`*::
  Set the highlight indicator in position `button` to state `state`. +
//FIXME Document "strings letters"
  You can use _strings letters_ (`LRCTBXA`) or _position_ `ENUMS` for the button argument.
*`set_button_icon(_button_, _pixmap_)`*::
  Sets the button's icon pixmap.
*`set_button_text(_button_, _text_)`*::
  Sets the button's icon text.
*`set_tooltip(_button_, _text_)`*::
  Sets the buttons pop-up tooltip descriptive text.
*`setLight(_state_)`*::
  Sets the highlight indicator to the `True` color or `False` color. +
  The `set_highlight()` function must be used prior to set the indicator to use.

.Signals
These signals will be *sent when buttons are pressed*.

They can be connected to in Qt Designer editor or Python code.

The first two output a string that indicates the button pressed:

*`joy_btn_pressed`* _(string)_::
*`joy_btn_released`* _(string)_::
*`joy_l_pressed`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_l_released`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_r_pressed`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_r_released`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_c_pressed`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_c_released`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_t_pressed`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_t_released`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_b_pressed`* _(bool)_::
*`joy_b_released`* _(bool)_::
// end definition list

They are based on PyQt's  _Signal_ (`QtCore.pyqtSignal()`)

.Slots
Slots can be connected to in Qt Designer editor or Python code:

*`set_colorStateTrue()`*::
*`set_colorStateFalse()`*::
*`set_colorState(_bool_)`*::

*`set_true_color(_str_)`*::
*`set_true_color(_qcolor_)`*::

*`set_false_color(_str_)`*::
*`set_false_color(_qcolor_)`*::
// end definition list

.Properties
These can be set in stylesheets or Python code:

*`highlightPosition`*::
  Set the indicator position.
*`setColorState`*::
  Select the color state of the indicator.
*`left_image_path`*::
*`right_image_path`*::
*`center_image_path`*::
*`top_image_path`*::
*`bottom_image_path`*::
  A file path or resource path to an image to display in the described button location. +
  If the reset button is pressed in Qt Designer editor property, the image will not be displayed (allowing optionally text).
*`left_text`*::
*`right_text`*::
*`center_text`*::
*`top_text`*::
*`bottom_text`*::
  A text string to be displayed in the described button location. +
  If left blank an image can be designated to be displayed.
*`true_color`*::
*`false_color`*::
  Color selection for the center LED ring to be displayed, when the `BASENAME.light.center` _HAL pin_ is `True` or `False`.
*`text_color`*::
  Color selection for the button text.
*`button_font`*::
  Font selection for the button text.

The above properties could be set in:

* *Stylesheets*: +
  You would usually use the Qt Designer widget name with `#` _prefix_ to set individual widget properties,
  otherwise you would use the `JoyPad` _class name_ to set all `JoyPad` widgets the same:
+
[source,{css}]
----
#joypadname{
  qproperty-true_color: #000;
  qproperty-false_color: #444;
}
----

* *In Python handler code*: +
+
[source,python]
----
self.w.joypadename.setProperty('true_color','green')
self.w.joypadename.setProperty('false_color','red')
----

=== 'WebWidget'
This widget will create a html/pdf viewing page using the QtWebKit or QtWebEngine libraries.
The newer QtWebEngine is preferred if both are on the system. +
If the QtWebEngine library is used with the Qt Designer editor, a placeholder QWidget will show in Qesigner.
This will be replaced with the QtWebEngine widget at run time.

=== `IndicatedPushButtons`

This class *modifies `QPushButton` behaviour*.

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:indicatedpushbutton:led]]
==== Indicator Option

*`indicator_option`* _puts a 'LED' on the top of the button_.

.QtVCP `PushButton`: Indicated Action Button, LED Indicator Option
image::images/qtvcp_actionButton.png["QtVCP PushButton: Indicated Action Button, LED Indicator Option",scale="25%",align="center"]

//FIXME Better document IndicatedPushButton
// https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/blob/master/lib/python/qtvcp/widgets/simple_widgets.py#L317
It can be a _triangle_, _circle_, _top bar_, or _side bar_. +
The _size_ and _position_ can be adjusted.

It will indicate:

* the *current state of the button*, or
* the *state of a HAL pin*, or
* *LinuxCNC status*.

.Properties
These properties are available to customize the indicator (not all are applicable to every LED shape):

*`on_color`*::
*`off_color`*::
*`flashIndicator`*::
*`flashRate`*::
*`indicator_size`*::
*`circle_diameter`*::
*`shape_option`*::
*`right_edge_offset`*::
*`top_edge_offset`*::
*`height_fraction`*::
*`width_fraction`*::
*`corner_radius`*:: Indicator corner radius.

The LED indicator color can be defined in a _stylesheet_ with the following code added to the `.qss` file:

[source,{css}]
----
Indicated_PushButton{
  qproperty-on_color: #000;
  qproperty-off_color: #444;
}
----

Or for a particular button:

[source,{css}]
----
Indicated_PushButton #button_estop{
  qproperty-on_color: black;
  qproperty-off_color: yellow;
}
----

.Options
`IndicatedPushButton` have *exclusive options*:

*`indicator_HAL_pin_option`*::
  Adds a `halpin`, named `<buttonname>-led` that controls the button indicator state.
*`indicator_status_option`*::
  Makes the LED indicate the state of these selectable LinuxCNC status:
+
* _Is Estopped_
* _Is On_
* _All Homed_
* _Is Joint Homed_
* _Idle_
* _Paused_
* _Flood_
* _Mist_
* _Block Delete_
* _Optional Stop_
* _Manual_
* _MDI_
* _Auto_
* _Spindle Stopped_
* _Spindle Forward_
* _Spindle Reverse_
* _On Limits_

+
Some `indicator_status_options` holds a property that can be used with a _stylesheet_
to change the color of the button based on the state of the property in LinuxCNC. +
Currently these status properties can be used to auto style buttons:

* `is_estopped_status` will toggle the `isEstop` property
* `is_on_status` will toggle the `isStateOn` property
* `is_manual_status`, `is_mdi_status`, `is_auto_status` will toggle the `isManual`, `isMDI`, `isAuto` properties.
* `is_homed_status` will toggle the 'isAllHomed' property

Here is a sample stylesheet entry setting the background of mode button widgets when LinuxCNC is in that mode:

[source,{css}]
----
ActionButton[isManual=true] {
    background: red;
}
ActionButton[isMdi=true] {
    background: blue;
}
ActionButton[isAuto=true] {
    background: green;
}
----

Here is how you specify a particular widget by its objectName in Qt Designer:

[source,{css}]
----
ActionButton #estop button [isEstopped=false] {
    color: yellow;
}
----

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:indicatedpushbutton:state-enabled]]
==== Enabled by LinuxCNC State

Often, having the button disabled and enabled based on the state of LinuxCNC's motion controller is necessary.

There are several properties that can be selected to aid with this:

*`isAllHomedSentive`*::
*`isOnSensitive`*::
*`isIdleSensitive`*::
*`isRunSensitive`*::
*`isRunPausedSensitive`*::
*`isManSensitive`*::
*`isMDISensitive`*::
*`isAutoSensitive`*::

You can select multiple properties for combined requirements.

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:indicatedpushbutton:state-text]]
==== Text Changes On State

//FIXME What is a 'checkable' button ? A checkbox ?
Choosing the *`checked_state_text_option`* allows a 'checkable' button to _change the text based on its checked state_.

It uses the following properties to specify the text for each state:

*`true_state_string`*::
*`false_state_string`*::

`\\n` will be converted to a newline.

You can set/change these in stylesheets:

[source,{css}]
----
ActionButton #action_aux{
  qproperty-true_state_string: "Air\\nOn";
  qproperty-false_state_string: "Air\\nOff";
}
----

[[sub:qtvcp:widgets:indicatedpushbutton:python-command]]
==== Call Python Commands On State

The *`python_command_option`* allow small snippets of Python code to be run from the push of a button, without having to edit the handler file.
Though, it can call functions in the handler file.

When using the `command_string` properties.

*`true_python_cmd_string`*::
  A Python command that will be called when the button is toggled `True`.
*`false_python_cmd_string`*::
  A Python command that will be called when the button is toggled `False`.

_Special capitalized words_ will give access to the following:

*`INSTANCE`*::
  Will give access to the widgets instances and handler functions. +
  E.g., `INSTANCE.my_handler_function_call(True)`
*`ACTION`*::
  Will give access to QtVCP's `ACTION` library. +
  E.g., `ACTION.TOGGLE_FLOOD()`
*`PROGRAM_LOADER`*::
  Will give access to QtVCP's `PROGRAM_LOADER` library. +
  E.g., `PROGRAM_LOADER.load_halshow()`
*`HAL`*::
  Will give access to HAL's Python module. +
  E.g., `HAL.set_p('motion.probe-input','1')`

[[sec:qtvcp:widgets:import-only]]
== Import-Only Widgets

These widgets are usually the *base class widget for other QtVCP widgets*.

==== Adding Custom Subroutines
You can create your own subroutines for use with NGCGUI.
They must follow these rules:

* For creating a subroutine for use with NGCGUI, the filename and the subroutine name must be the same.
* The subroutine must be in a folder within LinuxCNC's INI designated search path.
* On the first line there may be a comment of type info:
* The subroutine must be surrounded by the sub and endsub tags.
* The variables used must be numbered variables and must not skip number.
* Comments and presets may be included.
* If an image file of the same name is in the folder, it will be shown.
