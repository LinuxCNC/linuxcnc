= Python Virtual Control Panel

== Introduction

.Python Virtual Control Panel

The PyVCP (Python Virtual Control Panel) is designed to give the
integrator the ability to customize the AXIS interface with buttons and
indicators to do special tasks.

Hardware machine control panels can use up a lot of I/O pins and can
be expensive. That is where Virtual Control Panels have the advantage
as well as it cost nothing to build a PyVCP.

Virtual Control Panels can be used for testing or monitoring things to
temporarily replace real I/O devices while debugging ladder logic, or
to simulate a physical panel before you build it and wire it to an I/O
board.

The following graphic displays many of the PyVCP widgets.

== Panel Construction

The layout of a PyVCP panel is specified with an XML file that
contains widget tags between <pyvcp> and </pyvcp>. For example:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<pyvcp>
    <label text="This is a LED indicator"/>
    <led/>
</pyvcp>
-------------------------------------------------

image::images/pyvcp_mypanel.png[]

If you place this text in a file called tiny.xml, and run

----------------------------------------------
halcmd loadusr pyvcp -c mypanel tiny.xml
----------------------------------------------

PyVCP will create the panel for you, which includes two widgets, a
Label with the text 'This is a LED indicator', and a LED, used for
displaying the state of a HAL BIT signal. It will also create a HAL
component named 'mypanel' (all widgets in this panel are connected to
pins that start with 'mypanel.'). Since no <halpin> tag was present
inside the <led> tag, PyVCP will automatically name the HAL pin for the
LED widget mypanel.led.0

For a list of widgets and their tags and options, see the widget
reference below.

Once you have created your panel, connecting HAL signals to and from
the PyVCP pins is done with the halcmd:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
net <signal-name> <pin-name> <opt-direction> <opt-pin-name>signal-name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are new to HAL, the HAL basics chapter in the Integrator
Manual is a good place to start.

== Security

Parts of PyVCP files are evaluated as Python code, and can take any
action available to Python programs. Only use PyVCP .xml files from a
source that you trust.

[[sec:pyvcp-with-axis]]

== AXIS

Since AXIS uses the same GUI toolkit (Tkinter) as PyVCP, it is
possible to include a PyVCP panel on the right side of the normal AXIS
user interface. A typical example is explained below.

Place your PyVCP XML file describing the panel in the same directory
where your .ini file is. Say we we want to display the current spindle
speed using a Bar widget. Place the following in a file called
spindle.xml:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<pyvcp>
    <label>
        <text>"Spindle speed:"</text>
    </label>
    <bar>
        <halpin>"spindle-speed"</halpin>
        <max_>5000</max_>
    </bar>
</pyvcp>
-------------------------------------------------

Here we've made a panel with a Label and a Bar widget, specified that
the HAL pin connected to the Bar should be named 'spindle-speed', and
set the maximum value of the bar to 5000 (see widget reference below
for all options). To make AXIS aware of this file, and call it at start
up, we need to specify the following in the [DISPLAY] section of the
.ini file:

-----------------------------
PYVCP = spindle.xml
-----------------------------

To make our widget actually display the spindle-speed it needs to be
hooked up to the appropriate HAL signal. A .hal file that will be run
once AXIS and PyVCP have started can be specified in the [HAL] section
of the .ini file:

---------------------------------------
POSTGUI_HALFILE = spindle_to_pyvcp.hal
---------------------------------------

This change will run the HAL commands specified in
'spindle_to_pyvcp.hal'. In our example the contents could look like
this:

-------------------------------------------------
net spindle-rpm-filtered => pyvcp.spindle-speed
-------------------------------------------------

assuming that a signal called 'spindle-rpm-filtered' already exists.
Note that when running together with AXIS, all PyVCP widget HAL pins
have names that start with 'pyvcp.'.

image::images/pyvcp_axis_lathe.png[]

This is what the newly created PyVCP panel should look like in AXIS.
The 'sim/lathe' configuration is already configured this way.

== Stand Alone

This section describes how PyVCP panels can be displayed on their own
with or without LinuxCNC's machine controller.

To load a stand alone PyVCP panel with LinuxCNC use these commands:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
loadusr -Wn mypanel pyvcp -g WxH+X+Y -c mypanel <path/>panel_file.xml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You would use this if you wanted a floating panel or a panel with a
GUI other than AXIS.

* '-Wn panelname' - 
     makes HAL wait for the component 'panelname' to finish loading
    ('become ready' in HAL speak) before processing more HAL commands. This
    is important because PyVCP panels export HAL pins, and other HAL
    components will need them present to connect to them. Note the capital
    W and lowercase n. If you use the -Wn option you must use the -c option
    to name the panel.

* 'pyvcp < -g> < -c> panel.xml' - 
     builds the panel with the optional geometry and/or panelname from the
    xml panel file. The panel.xml can be any name that ends in .xml. The
    .xml file is the file that describes how to build the panel. You must
    add the path name if the panel is not in the directory that the HAL
    script is in. 

* '-g <WxH><+X+Y>' - 
     specifies the geometry to be used when constructing the panel. The
    syntax is 'Width x Height + X Anchor + Y Anchor'. You can set the size
    or position or both. The anchor point is the upper left corner of the
    panel. An example is -g 250x500+800+0 This sets the panel at 250 pixels
    wide, 500 pixels tall, and anchors it at X800 Y0.

* '-c panelname' - 
     tells PyVCP what to call the component and also the title of the
    window. The panelname can be any name without spaces. 

To load a 'stand alone' PyVCP panel without LinuxCNC use this command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
loadusr -Wn mypanel pyvcp -g 250x500+800+0 -c mypanel mypanel.xml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The minimum command to load a pyvcp panel is:

-----------------------------
loadusr pyvcp mypanel.xml
-----------------------------

You would use this if you want a panel without LinuxCNC's machine
controller such as for testing or a standalone DRO.

The loadusr command is used when you also load a component that will
stop HAL from closing until it's done. If you loaded a panel and then
loaded Classic Ladder using 'loadusr -w classicladder',
CL would hold HAL open (and the panel)  until you closed CL.
The '-Wn' above means wait for the component '-Wn "name"' to become ready.
('name' can be any name. Note the capital W and lowercase n.)
The -c tells PyVCP to build a panel with the
name 'panelname' using the info in 'panel_file_name.xml'.
The name 'panel_file_name.xml' can be any name but must end in .xml - it is the
file that describes how to build the panel. You must add the path name
if the panel is not in the directory that the HAL script is in.

An optional command to use if you want the panel to stop HAL from
continuing commands / shutting down. After loading any other components
you want the last HAL command to be:

-----------------------------
waituser panelname
-----------------------------

This tells HAL to wait for component 'panelname' to close before
continuing HAL commands. This is usually set as the last command so that
HAL shuts down when the panel is closed.

== Widgets

HAL signals come in two variants, bits and numbers. Bits are off/on
signals. Numbers can be 'float', 's32' or 'u32'. For more information on HAL
data types see the <<sec:hal-data,HAL Data>> section. The PyVCP widget
can either display the value of the signal with an indicator widget, or
modify the signal value with a control widget. Thus there are four
classes of PyVCP widgets that you can connect to a HAL signal. A fifth
class of helper widgets allow you to organize and label your panel.

 . Widgets for indicating 'bit' signals: led, rectled
 . Widgets for controlling 'bit' signals: button, checkbutton, radiobutton
 . Widgets for indicating 'number' signals: number, s32, u32, bar, meter
 . Widgets for controlling 'number' signals: spinbox, scale, jogwheel
 . Helper widgets: hbox, vbox, table, label, labelframe

=== Syntax

Each widget is described briefly, followed by the markup used, and a
screen shot. All tags inside the main widget tag are optional.

=== General Notes

At the present time, both a tag-based and an attribute-based syntax
are supported. For instance, the following XML fragments are treated
identically:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<led halpin="my-led"/>
---------------------------------------

and

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<led><halpin>"my-led"</halpin></led>
---------------------------------------

When the attribute-based syntax is used, the following rules are used
to turn the attributes value into a Python value:

 . If the first character of the attribute is one of the following, it is
   evaluated as a Python expression: '{(["''
 . If the string is accepted by int(), the value is treated as an integer
 . If the string is accepted by float(), the value is treated as
   floating-point
 . Otherwise, the string is accepted as a string.

When the tag-based syntax is used, the text within the tag is always
evaluated as a Python expression.

The examples below show a mix of formats.

.Comments

To add a comment use the xml syntax for a comment.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------
<!-- My Comment -->
-----------------------------

.Editing the XML file

Edit the XML file with a text editor. In most cases you can right
click on the file and select 'open with text editor' or similar.

[[pyvcp-colors]]
.Colors

Colors can be specified using the X11 rgb colors by name 'gray75' or
hex '#0000ff'. A complete list is located here
http://sedition.com/perl/rgb.html[http://sedition.com/perl/rgb.html].

Common Colors (colors with numbers indicate shades of that color)

 - white
 - black
 - blue and blue1 - 4
 - cyan and cyan1 - 4
 - green and green1 - 4
 - yellow and yellow1 - 4
 - red and red1 - 4
 - purple and purple1 - 4
 - gray and gray0 - 100

.HAL Pins

HAL pins provide a means to 'connect' the widget to something. Once
you create a HAL pin for your widget you can 'connect' it to another
HAL pin with a 'net' command in a .hal file. For more information on
the 'net' command see the <<sec:hal-commands,HAL Commands>> section.

=== Label

A label is a way to add text to your panel.

* '<label></label>' - creates a label

* '<text>"text"</text>' - the text to put in your label, a blank label can be
  used as a spacer to align other objects.

* '<font>("Helvetica",20)</font>' - specificy the font and size of the text

* '<relief>FLAT</relief>' - specificy the border around the label ('FLAT',
  'RAISED', 'SUNKEN') default is 'FLAT'

* '<bd>n</bd>' - where 'n' is the border width when 'RAISED' or 'SUNKEN' borders
  are used.

* '<padx>n</padx>' - where 'n' is the amount of extra horizontal extra space.

* '<pady>n</pady>' - where 'n' is the amount of extra vertical extra space.

The label has an optional disable pin that is created when you add
'<disable_pin>True</disable_pin>'.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<label>
    <text>"This is a Label:"</text>
    <font>("Helvetica",20)</font>
</label>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_label.png[]

=== Multi_Label

An extention of the text label.

Selectable text label, can display up to 6 label legends when associated bit pin
is activated.

Attach each legend pin to a signal and get a descriptive label when the signal
is TRUE.

If more than one legend pin is TRUE, the highest numbered 'TRUE' legend will be
displayed.

If a disable pin is created with '<disable_pin>True</disable_pin>' and that pin
is set to true the lable changes to a grayed out state.

[source,xml]
----
<multilabel>
    <legends>["Label1", "Label2", "Label3", "Label4", "Label5", "Label6"]</legends>
    <font>("Helvetica",20)</font>
    <disable_pin>True</disable_pin>
</multilabel>
----

The above example would create the following pins.

----
pyvcp.multilabel.0.disable
pyvcp.multilabel.0.legend0
pyvcp.multilabel.0.legend1
pyvcp.multilabel.0.legend2
pyvcp.multilabel.0.legend3
pyvcp.multilabel.0.legend4
pyvcp.multilabel.0.legend5
----

If you have more than one multilabel the pins created would increment the number
like this 'pyvcp.multilabel.1.legend1'.

=== LEDs

A LED is used to indicate the status of a 'bit' halpin. The LED color
will be on_color when the halpin is true, and off_color otherwise.

* '<led></led>' - makes a round LED

* '<rectled></rectled>' - makes a rectangle LED

* '<halpin>name</halpin>' - 'name' of the pin, default is 'led.n', where
  n is an integer that is incremented for each LED.

* '<size>n</size>' - 'n' is the size of the led in pixels, default is 20

* '<on_color>color</on_color>' - sets the color of the LED when the pin is true.
  default is 'green'. See <<pyvcp-colors,colors>> for more info.

* '<off_color>color</off_color>' - sets the color of the LED when the pin is
  false. default is 'red'

* '<height>n</height>' - sets the height of the LED in pixels

* '<width>n</width>' - sets the width of the LED in pixels

* '<disable_pin>false</disable_pin>' - when true adds a disable pin to the led.

* '<disabled_color>color</disabled_color>' - sets the color of the LED when the
  pin is disabled.

.Round LED

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<led>
    <halpin>"my-led"</halpin>
    <size>50</size>
    <on_color>"green"</on_color>
    <off_color>"red"</off_color>
</led>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

image::images/pyvcp_led.png[]

.Rectangle LED

This is a variant of the 'led' widget.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<vbox>
    <relief>RIDGE</relief>
    <bd>6</bd>
    <rectled>
        <halpin>"my-led"</halpin>
        <height>"50"</height>
        <width>"100"</width>
        <on_color>"green"</on_color>
        <off_color>"red"</off_color>
    </rectled>
</vbox>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 
Also showing a vertical box with relief. 

image::images/pyvcp_rectled.png[]

=== Buttons

A button is used to control a BIT pin. The pin will be set True when
the button is pressed and held down, and will be set False when the
button is released. Buttons can use the following optional options.

* '<padx>n</padx>' - where 'n' is the amount of extra horizontal extra space.

* '<pady>n</pady>' - where 'n' is the amount of extra vertical extra space.

* '<activebackground>"color"</activebackground>' - the cursor over color.

* '<fg> "color"</fg>' - the forground color.

* '<bg>"color"</bg>' - the background color.

* '<disable_pin>True</disable_pin>' - disable pin.

.Text Button

A text button controls a 'bit' halpin. The halpin is false until the
button is pressed then it is true. The button is a momentary button.

The text button has an optional disable pin that is created when you
add <disable_pin>True</disable_pin>.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<button>
    <halpin>"ok-button"</halpin>
    <text>"OK"</text>
</button>
<button>
    <halpin>"abort-button"</halpin>
    <text>"Abort"</text>
</button
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_button.png[]

.Checkbutton

A checkbutton controls a bit halpin. The halpin will be set True when the
button is checked, and false when the button is unchecked. The checkbutton is a
toggle type button. The Checkbuttons may be set initially as TRUE or FALSE the
initval field A pin called changepin is also created automatically, which can
toggle the Checkbutton via HAL, if the value linked is changed, to update the
display remotely.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<checkbutton>
    <halpin>"coolant-chkbtn"</halpin>
    <text>"Coolant"</text>
    <initval>1</initval>
</checkbutton>
<checkbutton>
    <halpin>"chip-chkbtn"</halpin>
    <text>"Chips    "</text>
    <initval>0</initval>
</checkbutton>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 
The coolant checkbutton is checked. 
Notice the extra spaces in the Chips text 
to keep the checkbuttons aligned. 

image::images/pyvcp_checkbutton.png[]

.Radiobutton

A radiobutton will set one of the halpins true. The other pins are set false.
The initval field may be set to choose the default selection when the panel
displays. Only one radio button may be set to TRUE (1) or only the highest
number pin set TRUE will have that value.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<radiobutton>
    <choices>["one","two","three"]</choices>
    <halpin>"my-radio"</halpin>
    <initval>0</initval>
</radiobutton>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_radiobutton.png[]

Note that the HAL pins in the example above will be named
my-radio.one, my-radio.two, and my-radio.three. In the image above,
'one' is the selected value.
Use this tag '<orient>HORIZONTAL</orient>' to display horizontally.

=== Number Displays

Number displays can use the following formatting options

* <font>("Font Name",n)</font> where 'n' is the font size
* <width>n</width> where 'n' is the overall width of the space used
* <justify>pos</justify> where 'pos' is LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT (doesn't work)
* <padx>n</padx> where 'n' is the amount of extra horizontal extra space
* <pady>n</pady> where 'n' is the amount of extra vertical extra space

.Number

The number widget displays the value of a float signal.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<number>
    <halpin>"my-number"</halpin>
    <font>("Helvetica",24)</font>
    <format>"+4.4f"</format>
</number>
--------------------------------------- 

The above code produced this example.
 
image::images/pyvcp_number.png[]

* '<font>' - is a Tkinter font type and size specification. One font that
will show up to at least size 200 is 'courier 10 pitch', so for a
really big Number widget you could specify:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<font>("courier 10 pitch",100)</font>
-------------------------------------------------

* '<format>' - is a 'C-style' format specified that determines how
the number is displayed.

.s32 Number

The s32 number widget displays the value of a s32 number. The syntax
is the same as 'number' except the name which is <s32>. Make sure the
width is wide enough to cover the largest number you expect to use.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<s32>
    <halpin>"my-number"</halpin>
    <font>("Helvetica",24)</font>
    <format>"6d"</format>
    <width>6</width>
</s32>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_s32.png[]

.u32 Number

The u32 number widget displays the value of a u32 number. The syntax
is the same as 'number' except the name which is <u32>.

.Bar

A bar widget displays the value of a FLOAT signal both graphically
using a bar display and numerically.
The color of the bar can be set as one color throughout its range (default
using fillcolor) or set to change color dependent upon the value of the halpin
(range1, range2 range3 must all be set, if you only want 2 ranges, set 2 of
them to the same color).

* <halpin>"my-bar"</halpin> text, sets the pin name, pyvcp.my-bar
* <min_>0</min_> number, sets the minimum scale
* <max_>140</max_> number, sets the maximum scale
* <format>"3.1f"</format> text, sets the number format using python number
  formatting
* <bgcolor>"grey"</bgcolor> text, sets the background color
* <fillcolor>"red"</fillcolor> text, sets the fill color
* <range1>0,100,"green"</range1> number, number, text, sets the first range and
  color
* <range2>101,135,"orange"</range2> number, number, text, sets the first range
  and color
* <range3>136, 150,"red"</range3> number, number, text, sets the first range and
  color
* <canvas_width>200</canvas_width> number, sets the overall width
* <canvas_height>50</canvas_height> number, sets the overall height
* <bar_height>30</bar_height> number, sets the bar height, must be less than
  canvas_height
* <bar_width>150</bar_width> number, sets the bar width, must be less than
  canvas_width

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<bar>
    <halpin>"my-bar"</halpin>
    <min_>0</min_>
    <max_>123</max_>
    <format>"3.1f"</format>
    <bgcolor>"grey"</bgcolor>
    <fillcolor>"red"</fillcolor>
    <range1>0,100,"green"</range1>
    <range2>101,135,"orange"</range2>
    <range3>136, 150,"red"</range3>
    <canvas_width>200</canvas_width>
    <canvas_height>50</canvas_height>
    <bar_height>30</bar_height>
    <bar_width>150</bar_width>
</bar>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_bar.png[]

.Meter

Meter displays the value of a FLOAT signal using a traditional dial indicator.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<meter>
    <halpin>"mymeter"</halpin>
    <text>"Battery"</text>
    <subtext>"Volts"</subtext>
    <size>250</size>
    <min_>0</min_>
    <max_>15.5</max_>
    <majorscale>1</majorscale>
    <minorscale>0.2</minorscale>
    <region1>(14.5,15.5,"yellow")</region1>
    <region2>(12,14.5,"green")</region2>
    <region3>(0,12,"red")</region3>
</meter>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_meter.png[]

=== Number Inputs

.Spinbox

Spinbox controls a FLOAT pin. You increase or decrease the value of the pin by
either pressing on the arrows, or pointing at the spinbox and rolling your
mouse-wheel. If the param_pin field is set TRUE(1), a pin will be created that
can be used to set the spinbox to an initial value and to remotely alter its
value without HID input.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<spinbox>
    <halpin>"my-spinbox"</halpin>
    <min_>-12</min_>
    <max_>33</max_>
    <initval>0</initval>
    <resolution>0.1</resolution>
    <format>"2.3f"</format>
    <font>("Arial",30)</font>
    <param_pin>1</param_pin>
</spinbox>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example. 

image::images/pyvcp_spinbox.png[]

.Scale

Scale controls a float or a s32 pin. You increase or decrease the
value of the pin be either dragging the slider, or pointing at the
scale and rolling your mouse-wheel. The 'halpin' will have both '-f'
and '-i' added to it to form the float and s32 pins. Width is the width
of the slider in vertical and the height of the slider in horizontal
orientation. If the param_pin field is set TRUE(1), a pin will be created that
can be used to set the spinbox to an initial value and to remotely alter its
value without HID input.


[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<scale>
    <font>("Helvetica",16)</font>
    <width>"25"</width>
    <halpin>"my-hscale"</halpin>
    <resolution>0.1</resolution>
    <orient>HORIZONTAL</orient>
    <initval>-15</initval>
    <min_>-33</min_>
    <max_>26</max_>
    <param_pin>1</param_pin>
</scale>
<scale>
    <font>("Helvetica",16)</font>
    <width>"50"</width>
    <halpin>"my-vscale"</halpin>
    <resolution>1</resolution>
    <orient>VERTICAL</orient>
    <min_>100</min_>
    <max_>0</max_>
    <param_pin>1</param_pin>
</scale>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

image::images/pyvcp_scale.png[]

.Dial

The Dial outputs a HAL float and reacts to both mouse wheel and
dragging. Double left click to increase the resolution and double right
click to reduce the resolution by one digit. The output is capped by
the min and max values. The <cpr> is how many tick marks are on the
outside of the ring (beware of high numbers). If the param_pin field is set
TRUE(1), a pin will be created that can be used to set the spinbox to
an initial value and to remotely alter its value without HID input.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dial>
    <size>200</size>
    <cpr>100</cpr>
    <min_>-15</min_>
    <max_>15</max_>
    <text>"Dial"</text>
    <initval>0</initval>
    <resolution>0.001</resolution>
    <halpin>"anaout"</halpin>
    <dialcolor>"yellow"</dialcolor>
    <edgecolor>"green"</edgecolor>
    <dotcolor>"black"</dotcolor>
    <param_pin>1</param_pin>
</dial>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

image::images/pyvcp_dial.png[]

.Jogwheel

Jogwheel mimics a real jogwheel by outputting a FLOAT pin which counts
up or down as the wheel is turned, either by dragging in a circular
motion, or by rolling the mouse-wheel.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<jogwheel>
    <halpin>"my-wheel"</halpin>
    <cpr>45</cpr>
    <size>250</size>
</jogwheel>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

image::images/pyvcp_jogwheel.png[]

=== Images

Image displays use only .gif image format. All of the images must be
the same size. The images must be in the same directory as your ini
file (or in the current directory if running from the command line with
halrun/halcmd).

.Image Bit

The 'image_bit' toggles between two images by setting the halpin to
true or false.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------
<image name='fwd' file='fwd.gif'/>
<image name='rev' file='rev.gif'/>
<vbox>
    <image_bit halpin='selectimage' images='fwd rev'/>
</vbox>
-----------------------------------------------------------

This example was produced from the above code.
Using the two image files fwd.gif and rev.gif.
FWD is displayed when 'selectimage' is false
and REV is displayed when 'selectimage' is true.

.Image u32

The 'image_u32' is the same as 'image_bit' except you have essentially
an unlimited number of images and you 'select' the image by setting the
halpin to a integer value with 0 for the first image in the images list
and 1 for the second image etc.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<image name='stb' file='stb.gif'/>
<image name='fwd' file='fwd.gif'/>
<image name='rev' file='rev.gif'/>
<vbox>
    <image_u32 halpin='selectimage' images='stb fwd rev'/>
</vbox>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The above code produced the following example
by adding the stb.gif image.

Notice that the default is the min even though it is set higher than
max unless there is a negative min.

=== Containers

Containers are widgets that contain other widgets. Containers are used
to group other widgets.

.Borders

Container borders are specified with two tags used together. The
<relief> tag specifies the type of border and the <bd> specifies the
width of the border.

* '<relief>type</relief>' -
    Where 'type' is FLAT, SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, or RIDGE

* '<bd>n</bd>' - 
    Where 'n' is the width of the border.

[source,xml]
----
<hbox>
    <button>
        <relief>FLAT</relief>
        <text>"FLAT"</text>
        <bd>3</bd>
    </button>
    <button>
        <relief>SUNKEN</relief>
        <text>"SUNKEN"</text>
        <bd>3</bd>
    </button>
    <button>
        <relief>RAISED</relief>
        <text>"RAISED"</text>
        <bd>3</bd>
    </button>
    <button>
        <relief>GROOVE</relief>
        <text>"GROOVE"</text>
        <bd>3</bd>
    </button>
    <button>
        <relief>RIDGE</relief>
        <text>"RIDGE"</text>
        <bd>3</bd>
    </button>
</hbox>
----

The above code produced this example.

.Fill

Container fill are specified with the '<boxfill fill=""/>' tag. Valid entries
are none, x, y and both. The x fill is a horizontal fill and the y fill is a 
vertical fill

* '<boxfill fill ="style"/>' - 
    Where 'style' is none, x, y, or both. Default is x for Vbox and y for Hbox.

.Anchor

Container anchors are specificed with the <boxanchor anchor=""/> tag. The anchor
specifies where to position each slave in its parcel. Valid entries are center,
n, s, e, w, for center, north, south, east and west. Combinations like sw, se,
nw and ne are also valid.

* '<boxanchor anchor="position"/>' -
    Where 'position' is center, n, s, e, w, ne, nw, se or sw. Default is center.

.Expand

Container expand is specificed with the boolean <boxexpand expand=""/> tag.
Valid entries are yes, no.

* '<boxexpand expand="boolean"/>' -
    Where 'boolean' is either yes or no. Default is yes.

.Hbox

Use an Hbox when you want to stack widgets horizontally
next to each other.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<hbox>
    <relief>RIDGE</relief>
    <bd>6</bd>
    <label><text>"a hbox:"</text></label>
    <led></led>
    <number></number>
    <bar></bar>
</hbox>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

image::images/pyvcp_hbox.png[]

Inside an Hbox, you can use the '<boxfill fill=""/>', '<boxanchor anchor=""/>'
, and '<boxexpand expand=""/>' tags to choose how items in the box behave when
the window is re-sized.The default is 'fill="y"', 'anchor="center"', 'expand="yes"'
for a Hbox.

.Vbox

Use a Vbox when you want to stack widgets vertically on top of each
other.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
<vbox>
    <relief>RIDGE</relief>
    <bd>6</bd>
    <label><text>"a vbox:"</text></label>
    <led></led>
    <number></number>
    <bar></bar>
</vbox>
-------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

image::images/pyvcp_vbox.png[]

Inside a Vbox, you can use the '<boxfill fill=""/>', '<boxanchor anchor=""/>'
, and '<boxexpand expand=""/>' tags to choose how items in the box behave
when the window is re-sized. The default is 'fill="x"', 'anchor="center"',
'expand="yes"' for a Hbox.

.Labelframe

A labelframe is a frame with a groove and a label at the upper-left
corner.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<labelframe text="Group Title">
    <font>("Helvetica",16)</font>
    <hbox>
    <led/>
    <led/>
    </hbox>
</labelframe>
---------------------------------------

The above code produced this example.

.Table

A table is a container that allows layout in a grid of rows and
columns. Each row is started by a '<tablerow/>' tag. A contained
widget may span rows or columns through the use of
the '<tablespan rows= cols=/>' tag. The sides of the cells to which
the contained widgets “stick”
may be set through the use of the '<tablesticky sticky=/>' tag. A
table expands on its flexible rows and columns.

Example:
[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------
<table flexible_rows="[2]" flexible_columns="[1,4]">
<tablesticky sticky="new"/>
<tablerow/>
    <label>
        <text>" A (cell 1,1) "</text>
        <relief>RIDGE</relief>
        <bd>3</bd>
    </label>
    <label text="B (cell 1,2)"/>
    <tablespan columns="2"/>
    <label text="C, D (cells 1,3 and 1,4)"/>
<tablerow/>
    <label text="E (cell 2,1)"/>
    <tablesticky sticky="nsew"/>
    <tablespan rows="2"/>
    <label text="'spans\n2 rows'"/>
    <tablesticky sticky="new"/>
    <label text="G (cell 2,3)"/>
    <label text="H (cell 2,4)"/>
<tablerow/>
    <label text="J (cell 3,1)"/>
    <label text="K (cell 3,2)"/>
    <u32 halpin="test"/>
</table>

.Tabs

A tabbed interface can save quite a bit of space.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------
<tabs>
    <names> ["spindle","green eggs"]</names>
</tabs>
<tabs>
    <names>["Spindle", "Green Eggs", "Ham"]</names>
    <vbox>
        <label>
            <text>"Spindle speed:"</text>
        </label>
        <bar>
            <halpin>"spindle-speed"</halpin>
            <max_>5000</max_>
        </bar>
    </vbox>
    <vbox>
        <label>
            <text>"(this is the green eggs tab)"</text>
        </label>
    </vbox>
    <vbox>
        <label>
            <text>"(this tab has nothing on it)"</text>
        </label>
    </vbox>
</tabs>
-----------------------------------------------------------

The above code produced this example showing each tab selected.
