= GMOCCAPY

== Introduction

'GMOCCAPY' is a GUI for LinuxCNC, designed to be used with a touch screen,
but can also be used on normal screens with a mouse or hardware buttons and MPG
wheels, as it presents HAL Pins for the most common needs. Please find more
information in the following.

It offers the possibility to display up to 4 axis, support a lathe mode for 
normal and back tool lathe and can be adapted to nearly every need, because 
gmoccapy supports embedded tabs and side panels. 
As a good example for that see
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Gmoccapy_plasma[gmoccapy_plasma]

*gmoccapy 2 does support up to 5 axis and 8 joints. As gmoccapy 2 has been
changed in code to support the joint / axis changes in LinuxCNC it does not 
work on 2.7 or 2.6 branch!

It has support for integrated virtual keyboard (onboard or matchbox-keyboard),
so there is no need for a hardware keyboard or mouse, but it can also be used
with that hardware. Gmoccapy offers a separate settings page to configure most
settings of the GUI without editing files.

'GMOCCAPY' can be localized very easy, because the corresponding files are
separated from the linuxcnc.po files, so there is no need to translate unneeded
stuff. The files are placed in */src/po/gmoccapy*. Just copy the gmoccapy.pot
file to something like fr.po and translate that file with gtranslator or poedit.
After rebuilding, you got the GUI in your preference language. Please publish 
your translation, so it can be included in the official packages and be 
published to other users. At the Moment it is available in English, German, 
Spanish, Polish, Serbian and Hungarian. Feel free to help me to introduce more 
languages, *nieson@web.de*. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask.

== Requirements

Gmoccapy 2 has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian Wheezy, Jessie and MINT 18 
with LinuxCNC master. It fully support joint / axis changes of LinuxCNC, making 
it suitable as GUI for Scara, Robots or any other config with more joints than 
axis. So it do support also gantry configs. if you use other versions, please 
inform about problems and / or solutions on the
http://www.linuxcnc.org/index.php/english/forum/41-guis/26314-gmoccapy-a-new-screen-for-linuxcnc[LinuxCNC forum] or the
http://www.cncecke.de/forum/showthread.php?t=78549[German CNC Ecke Forum] or
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emc-users[LinuxCNC users mailing list]

The minimum screen resolution for gmoccapy, using it without side panels is
*979 x 750 Pixel*, so it should fit to every standard screen.

==  How To Get gmoccapy

Beginning with LinuxCNC 2.6 gmoccapy is included in the standard installation.
So the easiest way to get gmoccapy on you controlling PC, is just to get the
http://www.linuxcnc.org/index.php/english/download[ISO] and install
from the CD / DVD /USB-Stick.

If you do have already installed an earlier LinuxCNC version, check how to
update http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UpdatingTo2.6[here].

You will receive updates with the regular deb packages.

Gmoccapy 2 is only included in the actual master release. To get gmoccapy 2
you need to build from source or use http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/[buildbot].

You will get a similar screen to the following:
The design may variate depending on your config.

image::images/gmoccapy_3_axis.png[align="left"]

== Basic Configuration

There is really not to much to configure just to run gmoccapy, but there are some points 
you should take care off if you want to use all the features of the GUI.

You will find the following INI files included, just to show the basics: +
 +
 * gmoccapy.ini +
 * gmoccapy_4_axis.ini +
 * gmoccapy_lathe.ini +
 * gmoccapy_lathe_imperial.ini +
 * gmoccapy_left_panel.ini +
 * gmoccapy_right_panel.ini +
 * gmoccapy_messages.ini +
 * gmoccapy_pendant.ini +
 * gmoccapy_sim_hardware_button.ini +
 * gmoccapy_tool_sensor.ini +
 * gmoccapy_with_user_tabs.ini +
 * gmoccapy_XYZAB.ini +
 * gmoccapy_XYZAC.ini +
 * gmoccapy_XYZCW.ini +
 * gmoccapy-JA/Gantry/gantry_mm.ini +
 * gmoccapy-JA/scara/scara.ini +
 * gmoccapy-JA/table-rotary-tilting/xyzac-trt.ini +
 +
The names should explain the main intention of the different INI Files. +

If you use an existing configuration of your machine, just edit your INI according to this document. +

IMPORTANT: If you want to use <<gmoccapy:macros,MACROS>>, don't forget to set the path to your macros or 
subroutines folder as described below.

So let us take a closer look to the the INI file and what you need to include 
to use gmoccapy on your machine: +

[[gmoccapy:display-section]]
=== The DISPLAY Section

 [DISPLAY]
 DISPLAY = gmoccapy
 PREFERENCE_FILE_PATH = gmoccapy_preferences
 MAX_FEED_OVERRIDE = 1.5
 MAX_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE = 1.2
 MIN_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE = 0.5
 LATHE = 1
 BACK_TOOL_LATHE = 1
 PROGRAM_PREFIX = ../../nc_files/

''''

The most important part is to tell LinuxCNC to use gmoccapy, editing the [DISPLAY] section.

 [DISPLAY]
 DISPLAY = gmoccapy

 PREFERENCE_FILE_PATH = gmoccapy_preferences

The line PREFERENCE_FILE_PATH gives the location and name of the preferences file to be used.
In most cases this line will not be needed, it is used by gmoccapy to store your settings of the GUI, 
like themes, DRO units, colors, and keyboard settings, etc., see <<gmoccapy:settings-page,settings page>> for more details. 

[NOTE]
If no path or file is given, gmoccapy will use as default
<your_machinename>.pref, if no machine name is given in your INI File it will
use gmoccapy.pref  The file will be stored in your config directory, so the
settings will not be mixed if you use several configs. If you only want to use
one file for several machines, you need to include PREFERENCE_FILE_PATH in your
INI.

----
MAX_FEED_OVERRIDE = 1.5
----

Sets the maximum feed override, in the example given, you will be allowed to
override the feed by 150%. 

[NOTE]
If no value is given, it will be set to 1.0

----
MAX_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE = 1.2
MIN_SPINDLE_OVERRIDE = 0.5
----

Will allow you to change the spindle override within a limit from 50% to 120%.

[NOTE]
If no values are given, MAX will be set to 1.0 and MIN to 0.1

----
LATHE = 1
BACK_TOOL_LATHE = 1
----

The first line set the screen layout to control a lathe.

The second line is optional and will switch the X axis in a way you need for a
back tool lathe. Also the keyboard shortcuts will react in a different way.

[TIP]
See also the <<gmoccapy:lathe-section, Lathe Specific Section>>

* PROGRAM_PREFIX = ../../nc_files/

Is the entry to tell linuxcnc/gmoccapy where to look for the ngc files.

[NOTE]
If not specified Gmoccapy will look in the following order for ngc files:
linuxcnc/nc_files and then the users home directory.

[[gmoccapy:configuration-of-tabs-and-side-panels]]
.Configuration of tabs and side panels

You can add embedded programs to gmoccapy like you can do in axis, touchy and
gscreen. All is done by gmoccapy automatically if you include a few lines in
your INI file in the DISPLAY section.

If you never used a glade panel, I recommend to read the excellent documentation.
http://www.linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gui/gladevcp.html[Glade VCP]

.Example

----
 EMBED_TAB_NAME = DRO
 EMBED_TAB_LOCATION = ntb_user_tabs
 EMBED_TAB_COMMAND = gladevcp -x {XID} dro.glade

 EMBED_TAB_NAME = Second user tab
 EMBED_TAB_LOCATION = ntb_preview
 EMBED_TAB_COMMAND = gladevcp -x {XID} vcp_box.glade
----

All you have to take care off, is that you include for every tab or side panel
the mentioned three lines,

* EMBED_TAB_NAME = Represents the name of the tab or side panel, it is up to you
  what name you use, but it must be present!


* EMBED_TAB_LOCATION = Is the place where your program will be placed in the GUI.

.valid values are:

* ntb_user_tabs            (as main tab, covering the complete screen)'
* ntb_preview              (as tab on the preview side)'
* box_left                 (on the left, complete high of the screen)
* box_right                (on the right, in between the normal screen and the button list)
* box_coolant_and_spindle  (will hide the coolant and spindle frames and introduce your glade file here)
* box_cooling              (will hide the cooling frame and introduce your glade file)
* box_spindle              (will hide the spindle frame and introduce your glade file)
* box_vel_info             (will hide the velocity frames and introduce your glade file)
* box_custom_1             (will introduce your glade file left of vel_frame)
* box_custom_2             (will introduce your glade file left of cooling_frame)
* box_custom_3             (will introduce your glade file left of spindle_frame)
* box_custom_4             (will introduce your glade file right of spindle_frame)

See the different INI files included to see the differences

* EMBED_TAB_COMMAND = the command to execute, i.e.

----
gladevcp -x {XID} dro.glade
----

Includes a custom glade file called dro.glade in the mentioned location
The file must be placed in the config folder of your machine.

----
gladevcp h_buttonlist.glade
----

Will just open a new user window called h_buttonlist.glade note the difference,
this one is stand alone, and can be moved around independent from gmoccapy
window.

----
camview-emc -w {XID}
----

Will add a live image from a web cam to the location you specified. Take care
that camview-emc is installed, as it is not by default. Detailed information
for camview and linuxcnc at: http://psha.org.ru/b/camview-emc.html[cam view]

[NOTE]
camview is not longer supported, there are several solutions availible, just see 
the linuxcnc forum for details.
----
gladevcp -c gladevcp -u hitcounter.py -H manual-example.hal manual-example.ui
----

Will add a the panel manual-example.ui, include a custom python handler,
hitcounter.py and make all connections after realizing the panel according to
manual-example.hal.

Here are some examples:


.ntb_user_tabs - with integrated camview program

image::images/gmoccapy_ntb_user_tab.png[align="left"]

.ntb_preview - as maximized version

image::images/gmoccapy_ntb_preview_maximized_2.png[align="left"]

.ntb_preview

image::images/gmoccapy_ntb_preview.png[align="left"]

.box_left - showing gmoccapy in edit mode

image::images/gmoccapy_with_left_box_in_edit_mode.png[align="left"]

.box_right - and gmoccapy in MDI mode

image::images/gmoccapy_with_right_panel_in_MDI_mode.png[align="left"]

.Configuration of User Created Messages

Gmoccapy has the ability to create hal driven user messages. To use them you 
need to introduce some lines in the [DISPLAY] section of the INI file.

Here is how to set up 3 user pop up message dialogs the messages support pango 
markup language. Detailed information about the markup language can be found at 
https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html[Pango Markup]

----
MESSAGE_TEXT    = The text to be displayed, may be pango markup formatted
MESSAGE_TYPE    = "status" , "okdialog" , "yesnodialog"
MESSAGE_PINNAME = is the name of the hal pin group to be created
----

 * 'status' : Will just display a message as pop up window, using the messaging
   system of gmoccapy

 * 'okdialog' : Will hold focus on the message dialog and will activate a
  "-waiting" Hal_Pin OUT. Closing the message will reset the waiting pin

 * 'yesnodialog' : Will hold focus on the message dialog and will activate
   a "-waiting" Hal_Pin bit OUT it will also give access to an "-response"
   Hal_Pin Bit Out, this pin will hold 1 if the user clicks OK, and in all
   other states it will be 0 Closing the message will reset the waiting pin
   The response Hal Pin will remain 1 until the dialog is called again

.Example
----
MESSAGE_TEXT = This is a <span background="#ff0000" foreground="#ffffff">
info-message</span> test
MESSAGE_TYPE = status
MESSAGE_PINNAME = statustest

MESSAGE_TEXT = This is a yes no dialog test
MESSAGE_TYPE = yesnodialog
MESSAGE_PINNAME = yesnodialog

MESSAGE_TEXT = Text can be <small>small</small>, <big>big</big>, <b>bold</b <i>italic</i>, and even be <span color="red">colored</span>.
MESSAGE_TYPE = okdialog
MESSAGE_PINNAME = okdialog
----

The specific hal pin conventions for these can be found under the
<<gmoccapy:user-created-message, User Messages>>  hal pin section.

[[gmocappy:rs274ngc]]

=== The RS274NGC Section

----
[RS274NGC]
SUBROUTINE_PATH = macros
----

Sets the path to search for macros and other subroutines. If you want to use
several subroutine paths, just separate them wit ":"

[[gmoccapy:macros]]

=== The MACRO Section

You can add macros to gmoccapy, similar to touchy's way. A macro is nothing
else than a ngc-file. You are able to execute complete CNC programs in MDI
mode, by just pushing one button. To do so, you have to add a section like so:

----
[MACROS]
MACRO = i_am_lost
MACRO = hello_world
MACRO = jog_around
MACRO = increment xinc yinc
MACRO = go_to_position X-pos Y-pos Z-pos
----

This will add 5 macros to the MDI button list.

[NOTE]
As maximum 9 macros will appear in the GUI, due to space reasons. 
It is no error placing more in your INI file. The macro button will be displayed
in the order of the INI entries.

image::images/gmoccapy_mdi_hidden_keyboard.png[align="left"]

The name of the file must be *exactly the same* as the name given in the MACRO
line. So the macro '*i_am_lost*' will call the file '*i_am_lost.ngc*'.

.The macro files must follow some rules:

* the name of the file need to be the same as the name mentioned in the macro
  line, just with the ngc extension
* The file must contain a subroutine like so: '*O<i_am_lost> sub*', the name
  of the sub must match exactly (*case sensitive*) the name of the macro
* the file must end with an endsub '*O<i_am_lost> endsub*' followed by an
 '*M2*' command
* the files need to be placed in a folder specified in your INI file in the
  RS274NGC section (see <<gmocappy:rs274ngc,RS274NGC>>)

The code in between sub and endsub will be executed by pushing the
corresponding macro button.

[NOTE]
You will find the sample macros in macros folder placed in the gmoccapy
sim folder. If you have given several subroutine paths, they will be searched 
in the order of the given paths. The first file found will be used.

Gmoccapy will also accept macros asking for parameters like:

----
go_to_position X-pos Y-pos Z-pos
----

The parameters must be separated by spaces. This calls a file
'go_to_position.ngc' with the following content:

----
; Test file go to position
; will jog the machine to a given position

O<go_to_position> sub

G17
G21
G54
G61
G40
G49
G80
G90

;#1 = <X-Pos>
;#2 = <Y-Pos>
;#3 = <Z-Pos>

(DBG, Will now move machine to X = #1 , Y = #2 , Z = #3)
G0 X #1 Y #2 Z #3

O<go_to_position> endsub
M2
----

After pushing the '*execute macro button*', you will be asked to enter the
values for '*X-pos Y-pos Z-pos*' and the macro will only run if all values
have been given.

[NOTE]
If you would like to use a macro without any movement, see also the notes in <<sub:NOT_ENDING_MACROS,known problems>>

image::images/gmoccapy_getting_macro_info.png[align="left"]

[[gmoccapy:traj-section]]

=== The TRAJ Section

----
DEFAULT_LINEAR_VELOCITY = 85.0
MAX_VELOCITY = 230.000
----

Sets the maximal velocity and the default jog velocity of the machine.

[NOTE]
If DEFAULT_LINEAR_VELOCITY is not given, half of MAX_VELOCITY will be used.
if that value is also not given, it will default to 180
If MAX_VELOCITY is not given, it will default to 600

== HAL Pins

gmoccapy exports several hal pin to be able to react to hardware devices.
The goal is to get a GUI that may be operated in a tool shop, completely/mostly
without mouse or keyboard.

[NOTE]
You will have to do all connections to gmoccapy pins in your postgui.hal file,
because they are not available before loading the GUI completely. It is possible
to call several postgui hal files, making the config easier to debug. Just use 
a postgui_call_list.hal file. Connections to user panel must be made in a 
separate hal file, as the panels are loaded after the GUI. 
See <<gmoccapy:configuration-of-tabs-and-side-panels, Tabs and side panels>>
for details.

=== Right And Bottom Button Lists

The screen has two main button lists, one on the right side an one on the
bottom. The right handed buttons will not change during operation, but the
bottom button list will change very often. The buttons are count from up to
down and from left to right beginning with "0".

[NOTE]
the pin name for *gmoccapy2* has changed to order them better:

In hal_show you will see the right (vertical) buttons are:

* gmoccapy.v-button.button-0
* gmoccapy.v-button.button-1
* gmoccapy.v-button.button-2
* gmoccapy.v-button.button-3
* gmoccapy.v-button.button-4
* gmoccapy.v-button.button-5
* gmoccapy.v-button.button-6

and the bottom (horizontal) buttons are:

* gmoccapy.h-button.button-0
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-1
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-2
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-3
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-4
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-5
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-6
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-7
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-8
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-9

As the buttons in the bottom list will change according the mode and other
influences, the hardware buttons will activate different functions, and you
don't have to take care about switching functions around in hal, because that
is done completely by gmoccapy!

for a 3 axis XYZ machine the hal pin will react as follows:

in manual mode:

* gmoccapy.h-button.button-0 == open homing button
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-1 == open touch off stuff
* gmoccapy.h-button.button-2 ==

*So we have 67 reactions with only 10 hal pin!*

These pins are made available to be able to use the screen without an touch
panel, or protect it from excessive use by placing hardware buttons around
the panel.

image::images/gmoccapy_0_9_7_sim_hardware_button.png[align="left"]

=== Velocities And Overrides

All sliders from gmoccapy can be connected to hardware encoder or hardware
potentiometers.

[NOTE]
for gmoccapy2 the hal pin name has changed, as new controls has been implemented,
max velocity does not exist any more, as rapid override has been implemented. 
This change has been done as many user ask for that.

To connect encoders the following pin are exported:

* gmoccapy.jog.jog-velocity.counts        = HAL_S32  Jog velocity
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-velocity.count-enable  = HAL_BIT  Must be True, to enable counts

* gmoccapy.feed.feed-override.counts       = HAL_S32  feed override
* gmoccapy.feed.feed-override.count-enable = HAL_BIT  Must be True, to enable counts
* gmoccapy.feed.reset-feed-override        = HAL_BIT  reset the feed override to 100 %

* gmoccapy.spindle.spindle-override.counts       = HAL_S32  spindle override
* gmoccapy.spindle.spindle-override.count-enable = HAL_BIT  Must be True, to enable counts
* gmoccapy.spindle.reset-spindle-override        = HAL_BIT  reset the spindle override to 100 %

* gmoccapy.rapid.rapid_override.counts       = HAL_S32  Maximal Velocity of the machine
* gmoccapy.rapid.rapid_override.count-enable = HAL_BIT  Must be True, to enable counts

To connect potentiometers, use the following hal pin:

* gmoccapy.jog.jog-velocity.direct-value     = HAL_FLOAT To adjust the jog velocity slider
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-velocity.analog-enable    = HAL_BIT   Must be True, to allow analog inputs

* gmoccapy.feed.feed-override.direct-value   = HAL_FLOAT To adjust the feed override slider
* gmoccapy.feed.feed-override.analog-enable  = HAL_BIT   Must be True, to allow analog inputs

* gmoccapy.spindle.spindle-override.direct-value  = HAL_FLOAT To adjust the spindle override slider
* gmoccapy.spindle.spindle-override.analog-enable = HAL_BIT   Must be True, to allow analog inputs

* gmoccapy.rapid.rapid_override.direct-value  = HAL_FLOAT To adjust the max velocity slider
* gmoccapy.rapid.rapid_override.analog-enable = HAL_BIT   Must be True, to allow analog inputs

In addition gmoccapy 2 offers additional hal pin to control
the new slider widgets with momentary switches. The values how fast the increase
or decrease will be, must be set in the glade file. In a future release it will 
be integrated in the settings page.

* gmoccapy.spc_jog_vel.increase     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will increase
* gmoccapy.spc_jog_vel.decrease     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will decrease
* gmoccapy.spc_jog_vel.scale        = HAL_FLOAT IN   A value to scale the output value (Handy to change units/min to units/sec
* gmoccapy.spc_jog_vel.value        = HAL_FLOAT OUT  value of the widget
* gmoccapy.spc_jog_vel.scaled-value = HAL_FLOAT OUT  scaled value of the widget

* gmoccapy.spc_feed.increase     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will increase
* gmoccapy.spc_feed.decrease     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will decrease
* gmoccapy.spc_feed.scale        = HAL_FLOAT IN   A value to scale the output value (Handy to change units/min to units/sec
* gmoccapy.spc_feed.value        = HAL_FLOAT OUT  value of the widget
* gmoccapy.spc_feed.scaled-value = HAL_FLOAT OUT  scaled value of the widget

* gmoccapy.spc_spindle.increase     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will increase
* gmoccapy.spc_spindle.decrease     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will decrease
* gmoccapy.spc_spindle.scale        = HAL_FLOAT IN   A value to scale the output value (Handy to change units/min to units/sec
* gmoccapy.spc_spindle.value        = HAL_FLOAT OUT  value of the widget
* gmoccapy.spc_spindle.scaled-value = HAL_FLOAT OUT  scaled value of the widget

* gmoccapy.spc_rapid.increase     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will increase
* gmoccapy.spc_rapid.decrease     = HAL_BIT IN     as long as True the value of the slider will decrease
* gmoccapy.spc_rapid.scale        = HAL_FLOAT IN   A value to scale the output value (Handy to change units/min to units/sec
* gmoccapy.spc_rapid.value        = HAL_FLOAT OUT  value of the widget
* gmoccapy.spc_rapid.scaled-value = HAL_FLOAT OUT  scaled value of the widget

The float pin do accept values from 0.0 to 1.0, being the percentage value
you want to set the slider value.

[WARNING] If you use both connection types, do not connect the same slider to
both pin, as the influences between the two has not been tested! Different
sliders may be connected to the one or other hal connection type.

[IMPORTANT] Please be aware, jog velocity depends on the turtle button state, 
it will lead to different slider scales depending on the mode
(turtle or rabbit). Please take also a look to
<<gmoccapy:jog-velocity,jog velocities and turtle-jog hal pin>> for more
details.

.Example
----
Spindle Override Min Value =  20 %
Spindle Override Max Value = 120 %
gmoccapy.analog-enable = 1
gmoccapy.spindle-override-value = 0.25

value to set = Min Value + (Max Value - Min Value) * gmoccapy.spindle-override-value
value to set = 20 + (120 - 20) * 0.25
value to set = 45 %
----

=== Jog Hal Pins

All axis given in the INI File have a jog-plus and a jog-minus pin, so
hardware momentary switches can be used to jog the axis.

[NOTE]
naming of this hal pin has changed for gmoccapy2

For the standard XYZ config following hal Pin will be available:

* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-x-plus
* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-x-minus
* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-y-plus
* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-y-minus
* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-z-plus
* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-z-minus

If you use a 4 axis INI file, there will be two additional pins

* gmoccapy.jog.<your fourth axis letter >-plus
* gmoccapy.jog.<your fourth axis letter >-minus

For a "C" axis you will see:

* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-c-plus
* gmoccapy.jog.axis.jog-c-minus

[[gmoccapy:jog-velocity]]

=== Jog Velocities And Turtle-Jog Hal Pin

The jog velocity can be selected with the corresponding slider. The scale of
the slider will be modified if the turtle button (the one showing a rabbit or a
turtle) has been toggled. If the button is not visible, it might have been
disabled on the <<gmoccapy:turtle-jog,settings page>>. If the button shows the
rabbit-icon, the scale is from min to max machine velocity. If it shows the
turtle, the scale will reach only 1/20 of max velocity by default. The used
divider can be set on the <<gmoccapy:turtle-jog,settings page>>.

So using a touch screen it is much easier to select smaller velocities.

gmoccapy offers a hal pin to toggle between turtle and rabbit jogging

* gmoccapy.jog.turtle-jog   (Hal Bit In)

=== Jog Increment Hal Pins

The jog increments are selectable through hal pins, so a select hardware
switch can be used to select the increment to use. There will be a maximum
of 10 hal pin for the increments given in the INI File, if you give more
increments in your INI File, they will be not reachable from the GUI as they
will not be displayed.

[NOTE]
gmoccapy2 uses different hal pin naming

If you have 6 increments in your hal you will get *7* pins:
jog-inc-0 is unchangeable and will represent continuous jogging.

* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-0
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-1
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-2
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-3
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-4
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-5
* gmoccapy.jog.jog-inc-6


[[gmoccapy:hardware-unlock]]

=== Hardware Unlock Pin

To be able to use a key switch to unlock the settings page the following
pin is exported.

* gmoccapy.unlock-settings

The settings page is unlocked if the pin is high.
To use this pin, you need to activate it on the settings page.

=== Error Pins

 * gmoccapy.error
 * gmoccapy.delete-message

gmoccapy.error is an bit out pin, to indicate an error, so a light can lit or even the machine may
be stopped. It will be reseted with the pin gmoccapy.delete-message. gmoccapy.delete-message will
delete the first error and reset the gmoccapy.error pin to False after the last error has been cleared.

NOTE: Messages or user infos will not affect the gmoccapy.error pin, but the gmoccapy.delete-message
pin will delete the last message if no error is shown!

[[gmoccapy:user-created-message]]

=== User Created Message HAL Pins

gmoccapy may react to external errors, using 3 different user messages:
All are HAL_BIT pin.

'Status'

* gmoccapy.messages.statustest

'Yesnodialog'

* gmoccapy.messages.yesnodialog
* gmoccapy.messages.yesnodialog-waiting
* gmoccapy.messages.yesnodialog-responce

'Okdialog'

* gmoccapy.messages.okdialog
* gmoccapy.messages.okdialog-waiting

To add user created message you need to add the message to the INI file in the
[DISPLAY] section. Here are a couple of examples.

----
MESSAGE_BOLDTEXT = LUBE SYSTEM FAULT
MESSAGE_TEXT = LUBE FAULT
MESSAGE_TYPE = okdialog
MESSAGE_PINNAME = lube-fault

MESSAGE_BOLDTEXT = NONE
MESSAGE_TEXT = X SHEAR PIN BROKEN
MESSAGE_TYPE = status
MESSAGE_PINNAME = pin
----

To 'connect' new pins to and input you need to do this in the postgui HAL file.
Here are some example connections that have the signal connected to an input
some place else in the HAL file.

----
net gmoccapy-lube-fault gmoccapy.messages.lube-fault
net gmoccapy-lube-fault-waiting gmoccapy.messages.lube-fault-waiting
net gmoccapy-pin gmoccapy.messages.pin
----

For more information on HAL files and the net command see the
<<cha:basic-hal-reference,Basic HAL Reference>>.

=== Spindle Feedback Pins

There are two pins for spindle feedback

* gmoccapy.spindle_feedback_bar
* gmoccapy.spindle_at_speed_led

'gmoccapy.spindle_feedback_bar' will accept an float input to show the spindle
speed.
'gmoccapy.spindle_at_speed_led' is an bit-pin to lit the GUI led if spindle is
at speed.

=== Pins To Indicate Program Progress Information

There are three pins giving information over the program progress

* gmoccapy.program.length HAL_S32 showing the total number of lines of the
  program
* gmoccapy.program.current-line HAL_S32 indicating the current working line
  of the program
* gmoccapy.program.progress HAL_FLOAT giving the program progress in
  percentage

The values may not be very accurate, if you are working with subroutines or
large remap procedures, also loops will cause different values.

=== Tool related pin

.Tool Change Pin

This pin are provided to use gmoccapy's internal tool change dialog, similar to
the one known from axis, but with several modifications, so you will not only
get the message to change to 'tool number 3', but also the description of that
tool like '7.5 mm 3 flute cutter'. The information is taken from the tool
table, so it is up to you what to display.

image::images/manual_toolchange.png[align="left"]

* gmoccapy.toolchange-number HAL_S32 The number of the tool to be changed
* gmoccapy.toolchange-change HAL_BIT Indicate that a tool has to be changed
* gmoccapy.toolchange-changed HAL_BIT Indicate toll has been changed

Usually they are connected like this for a manual tool change:

----
net tool-change gmoccapy.toolchange-change <= iocontrol.0.tool-change
net tool-changed gmoccapy.toolchange-changed <= iocontrol.0.tool-changed
net tool-prep-number gmoccapy.toolchange-number <= iocontrol.0.tool-prep-number
net tool-prep-loop iocontrol.0.tool-prepare <= iocontrol.0.tool-prepared
----

.Tool Offset Pins

This pins allows you to show the active tool offset values for X and Z in the
tool information frame. You should know that they are only active after G43
has been sent.

image::images/gmoccapy_0_9_7_tool_info.png[align="left"]

* gmoccapy.tooloffset-x
* gmoccapy.tooloffset-z

Connect them in your postgui hal.

[NOTE]
the tooloffset-x line is not needed on a mill, and will not be displayed on a 
mill with trivial kinematics.
----
 net tooloffset-x gmoccapy.tooloffset-x <= motion.tooloffset.x
 net tooloffset-z gmoccapy.tooloffset-z <= motion.tooloffset.z
----

Please note, that gmoccapy takes care of its own to update the offsets,
sending an G43 after any tool change, *but not in auto mode!*

[IMPORTANT]
So writing a program makes you responsible to include an G43 after
each tool change!

[[gmoccapy:auto-tool-measurement]]

== Auto Tool Measurement

Gmoccapy offers an integrated auto tool measurement. To use this feature, you
will need to do some additional settings and you may want to use the
offered hal pin to get values in your own ngc remap procedure.

[IMPORTANT] Before starting the first test, do not forget to enter the probe
height and probe velocities on the settings page! See 
<<gmoccapy:tool-measurement,Settings Page Tool Measurement>>

It might be also a good idea to take a look at the tool measurement video:
see <<gmoccapy:tool-measurement-videos,tool measurement related videos>>

Tool Measurement in gmoccapy is done a little bit different to many other GUI.
You should follow these steps:

* touch of you workpiece in X and Y
* measure the hight of your block from the base where your tool switch is
  located, to the upper face of the block (including chuck etc.)
* Push the button block height and enter the measured value
* Go to auto mode and start your program

here is a small sketch:

image::images/sketch_auto_tool_measurement.png[align="left"]

With the first given tool change the tool will be measured and the offset will
be set automatically to fit the block height. The advantage of the gmoccapy
way is, that you do not need a reference tool.

[NOTE]
Your program must contain a tool change at the beginning! The tool will be
measured, even it has been used before, so there is no danger, if the block
height has changed. There are several videos showing the way to do that on
you tube.


=== Tool Measurement Pins

Gmoccapy offers 5 pins for tool measurement purpose. The pins are mostly used
to be read from a gcode subroutine, so the code can react to different values.

* gmoccapy.toolmeasurement HAL_BIT enable or not tool measurement
* gmoccapy.blockheight HAL_FLOAT the measured value of the top face of the
  workpiece
* gmoccapy.probeheight HAL_FLOAT the probe switch height
* gmoccapy.searchvel HAL_FLOAT the velocity to search for the tool probe switch
* gmoccapy.probevel HAL_FLOAT the velocity to probe tool length

=== Tool Measurement INI File Modifications

Modify your INI File to include the following:

.The RS274NGC section

----
[RS274NGC]
# Enables the reading of INI and HAL values from gcode
FEATURES=12

# is the sub, with is called when a error during tool change happens
ON_ABORT_COMMAND=O <on_abort> call

# The remap code
REMAP=M6  modalgroup=6 prolog=change_prolog ngc=change epilog=change_epilog
----

.The Tool Sensor Section

The position of the tool sensor and the start position of the probing movement,
all values are absolute coordinates, except MAXPROBE, what must be given in
relative movement.

----
[TOOLSENSOR]
X = 10
Y = 10
Z = -20
MAXPROBE =  -20
----

.The Change Position Section

This is not named TOOL_CHANGE_POSITION  on purpose - *canon uses that name and
will interfere otherwise.* The position to move the machine before giving the
change tool command. All values are in absolute coordinates.

----
[CHANGE_POSITION]
X = 10
Y = 10
Z = -2
----

.The Python Section

The Python plug ins serves interpreter and task.

----
[PYTHON]
# The path to start a search for user modules
PATH_PREPEND = python
# The start point for all.
TOPLEVEL = python/toplevel.py
----

=== Needed Files

You must copy the following files to your config directory

First make a directory 'python' in your config folder from
'your_linuxcnc-dev_directory/configs/sim/gmoccapy/python' copy 'toplevel.py' to
your 'config_dir/python' folder. Copy 'remap.py' to your 
'config_dir/python' folder Copy 'stdglue.py' to your 'config_dir/python'
folder.

From 'your_linuxcnc-dev_directory/configs/sim/gmoccapy/macros'
copy 'on_abort.ngc' to the directory specified in the SUBROUTINE_PATH see
<<gmocappy:rs274ngc, RS274NGC Section>>.
From 'your_linuxcnc-dev_directory/configs/sim/gmoccapy/macros'
copy 'change.ngc' to the directory specified as SUBROUTINE_PATH see
<<gmocappy:rs274ngc, RS274NGC Section>>.
Open 'change.ngc' with a editor and uncomment the following lines
(49 and 50):

----
F #<_hal[gmoccapy.probevel]>
G38.2 Z-4
----

You may want to modify this file to fit more your needs.

=== Needed Hal Connections

Connect the tool probe in your hal file like so:

----
net probe  motion.probe-input <= <your_input_pin>
----

The line might look like this:

-------
 net probe  motion.probe-input <= parport.0.pin-15-in
-------

In your postgui.hal file add:

-------
# The next lines are only needed if the pins had been connected before
unlinkp iocontrol.0.tool-change
unlinkp iocontrol.0.tool-changed
unlinkp iocontrol.0.tool-prep-number
unlinkp iocontrol.0.tool-prepared

# link to gmoccapy toolchange, so you get the advantage of tool description on change dialog
net tool-change gmoccapy.toolchange-change <= iocontrol.0.tool-change
net tool-changed gmoccapy.toolchange-changed <= iocontrol.0.tool-changed
net tool-prep-number gmoccapy.toolchange-number <= iocontrol.0.tool-prep-number
net tool-prep-loop iocontrol.0.tool-prepare <= iocontrol.0.tool-prepared
-------

[[gmoccapy:settings-page]]

== The Settings Page

To enter the page you will have to click on
image:images/gmoccapy_settings_button.png[align="left"]
and give an unlock code, witch is *123* as default. If you want to change it
at this time you will have to edit the hidden preference file, see
<<gmoccapy:display-section,the display section>> for details.

The page looks at the moment like so:

image::images/gmoccapy_settings_appearance.png[align="left"]

The page is separated in three main tabs:

=== Appearance

On this tab you will find the following options:

Main Window::
    Here you can select how you wish the GUI to start. The main reason for this was the wish to get an easy + 
    way for the user to set the starting options without the need to touch code. +
    +
    You have three options: + 

* start as full screen
* start maximized
* start as window
    +
    If you select start as window the spinboxes to set the position and size will get active. + 
    One time set, the GUI will start every time on the place and with the size selected. + 
    Nevertheless the user can change the size and position using the mouse, but that will +
    not have any influence on the settings. +

'*hide the cursor*' does allow to hide the cursor, what is very useful if you
use a touch screen.

Keyboard::
    The check-boxes allows the user to select if he want the on board keyboard to be shown immediately, + 
    when entering the MDI Mode, when entering the offset page, the tooledit widget or when open a program + 
    in the EDIT mode. The keyboard button on the bottom button list will not been affected by this settings, + 
    so you be able to show or hide the keyboard by pressing the button. The default behavior will be set by + 
    the check-boxes. + 
    + 
    Default are : +  

[NOTE]
If this section is not sensitive, you have not installed a virtual keyboard,
+ supported are 'onboard' and 'matchbox-keyboard'.

* show keyboard on offset = True
* show keyboard on tooledit = False
* show keyboard on MDI = True
* show keyboard on EDIT = True
* show keyboard on load file = False

If the keyboard layout is not correct, i.e. clicking X gives Z, than the
layout has not been set properly, related to your locale settings. For
onboard it can be solved with a small batch file with the following content:

----
 #!/bin/bash
 setxkbmap -model pc105 -layout de -variant basic
----

The letters "de" are for German, you will have to set them according to your
locale settings. Just execute this file before starting LinuxCNC, it can be
done also adding a starter to your local folder.

----
./config/autostart
----

So that the layout is set automatically on starting.

For matchbox-keyboard you will have to make your own layout, for a German
layout ask in the forum.

On Touch Off::
    give the option to show the preview tab or the offset page tab if you enter the touch off mode by clicking the 
    corresponding bottom button.

* show preview
* show offsets

As the notebook tabs are shown, you are able to switch between both views in
any case.

Show Aux Display::
    By clicking this button a additional window will be opened. This button is only sensitive, if a file named 'gmoccapy2.glade'
    is located in your config folder. You can build the Aux Screen using Glade. 

WARNING: 'The main window of the aux screen must be named window2'

DRO Options::
You have the option to select the background colors of the different DRO states.
So users suffering from protanopia (red/green weakness) are able to select proper colors

By default the backgrounds are:

* Relative mode  = black
* Absolute mode  = blue
* Distance to go = yellow

The foreground color of the DRO can be selected with:

* homed color   = green
* unhomed color = red

'show dro in preview' +
the DRO will be shown in the preview window + + 

'show offsets'+ 
the Offsets will be shown in the preview window + + 

'show DTG' + 
the distance to go will be shown in the preview window + + 
 +
'show DRO Button' + 
will allow you to display additional buttons on the left side of the DRO. +

It will display: +
* one button to switch from relative to absolute coordinates, +
* one button to toggle between distance to go and the other states +
* and one button to toggle the units from metric to imperial and vice versa.

[WARNING] It is not recommended to use this option, because the user will
loose the auto unit option, which will toggle the units according to the
active gcode G20 / G21.

[NOTE] *You can change through the DRO modes (absolute, relative, distance
to go) by clicking on the DRO!*

'Use Auto Units' + 
allows to disable the auto units option of the display, so you can run a program in inches and watch the DRO in mm. + + 

'size' + 
allows to set the size of the DRO font, default is 28, if you use a bigger screen you may want to increase the size up to 56. 
    If you do use 4 axis, the DRO font size will be 3/4 of the value, because of space reason. + + 

'digits' +  
sets the number of digits of the DRO from 1 to 5. + 
 
NOTE: Imperial will show one digit more that metric. So if you are in imperial machine units and set the digit value to 1, you will get no digit at all in metric.

'toggle DRO mode' + 
if not active, a mouse click on the DRO will not take any action. + 
By default this checkbox is active, so every click on any DRO will toggle the DRO readout from actual to relative to DTG (distance to go). + + 

Preview::

'Grid Size' Sets the grid size of the preview window. Unfortunately the size
*has to be set in inches*, even if your machine units are metric. We do hope
to fix that in a future release.

[NOTE] The grid will not be shown in perspective view.

'Show DRO' +
Will show the a DRO also in the preview window, it will be shown automatically in fullsize preview

'Show DTG' will show also the DTG (direct distance to end point) in the
preview, only if Show DRO is active and not full size preview.

'Show Offsets' will show the offsets in the preview window.

[NOTE] If you only check this option and leave the others unchecked, you will
get in full size preview a offset page

'Mouse Button Mode' this combobox you can select the button behavior of the
mouse to rotate, move or zoom within the preview.

* left rotate, middle move, right zoom
* left zoom, middle move, right rotate
* left move, middle rotate, right zoom
* left zoom, middle rotate, right move
* left move, middle zoom, right rotate
* left rotate, middle zoom, right move

Default is left move, middle zoom, right rotate.

The mouse wheel will still zoom the preview in every mode.

[TIP]
If you select an element in the preview, the selected element will be
taken as rotation center point.

File to load on start up::
    Select the file you want to be loaded on start up. 
    In other GUI changing this was very cumbersome, because the users where forced to edit the INI File.

Select the file you want to be loaded on start up. If a file is loaded, it can
be set by pressing the current button to avoid that any program is loaded at
start up, just press the None button.

The file selection screen will use the filters you have set in the INI File,
if there aren't any filters given, you will only see *ngc* files. The path
will be set according to the INI settings in [DISPLAY] PROGRAM_PREFIX

Jump to dir::
    you can set here the directory to jump to if you press the corresponding button 
    in the file selection dialog.

image::images/gmoccapy_file_selection_dialog_with_keyboard.png[align="left"]

Themes and Sounds::
    This lets the user select what desktop theme to apply and what error and messages sounds should be played.
    By default "Follow System Theme" is set.

=== Hardware

image::images/gmoccapy_settings_hardware.png[align="left"]

Hardware MPG Scales::
For the different Hal Pin to connect MPG Wheels to, you may select individual scales to be applied.
The main reason for this was my own test to solve this through hal connections, resulting in a very 
complex hal file. Imagine a user having an MPG Wheel with 100 ipr and he wants to slow down the max 
vel from 14000 to 2000 mm/min, that needs 12000 impulses, resulting in 120 turns of the wheel! 
Or an other user having a MPG Wheel with 500 ipr and he wants to set the spindle override witch has 
limits from 50 to 120 % so he goes from min to max within 70 impulses, meaning not even 1/4 turn.

By default all scales are set using the calculation:

----
(MAX - MIN)/100
----

Keyboard shortcuts::
Some users want to jog there machine using the keyboard buttons and there are others that will never allow this.
So everybody can select whether to use them or not.

Default is not to use keyboard shortcuts.

Please take care if you use a lathe, than the shortcuts will be different.
See <<gmoccapy:lathe-section,the Lathe section>>

 * Arrow Left  or NumPad_Left = X minus
 * Arrow Right or NumPad_Right = X plus
 * Arrow up or NumPad_Up = Y plus
 * Arrow Down or NumPad_Down = Y minus
 * Page Up or NumPad_Page_Up = Z plus
 * Page Down or NumPad_Page_Down = Z minus

 * F1 = Estop (will work even if keyboard shortcuts are disabled)
 * F2 = Machine on
 * F3 = manual mode
 * F5 = MDI mode
 
 * ESC = Abort
 
In AUTO Mode we will allow the following key shortcuts
 * R or r = run program
 * P or p = pause program
 * S or s = resume program

There are additional keys for message handling, see
<<gmoccapy:message-behavior,Message behavior and appearance>>

 * WINDOWS = Delete last message
 * <STRG><SPACE> = Delete all messages

Unlock options::

There are three options to unlock the settings page:

* use unlock code (the user must give a code to get in)
* Do not use unlock code (There will be no security check)
* Use hal pin to unlock  (hardware pin must be high to unlock the settings,
  see <<gmoccapy:hardware-unlock, hardware unlock pin>>

Default is use unlock code (default = *123*)

Spindle::
The start RPM sets the rpm to be used if the spindle is started and no S value has been set.

[NOTE]
This value will be preseted according to your settings in 
[DISPLAY] DEFAULT_SPINDLE_SPEED of your INI. If you change the settings on the
settings page, that value will be default from that moment, your INI File will
not be modified.

With the MIN and MAX settings you set the limits of the spindle bar shown in
the INFO frame on the main screen. It is no error giving wrong values. If you
give a maximum of 2000 and your spindle makes 4000 rpm, only the bar level will
be wrong on higher speeds than 2000 rpm.

----
default values are
MIN = 0
MAX = 6000
----

[[gmoccapy:turtle-jog]]

Turtle Jog:: [[sub:turtle_jog]]
This settings will have influence on the jog velocities.

* 'hide turtle jog button' will hide the button right of the jog velocity
slider, if you hide this button, please take care that it shows the rabbit
icon, otherwise you will not be able to jog faster than the turtle jog velocity,
which is calculated using the turtle jog factor.

* 'Turtle jog factor' sets the scale to apply for turtle jog mode. If you set
a factor of 20, the max jog velocity will be 1/20 of max velocity of the machine
if in turtle mode (button pressed, showing the turtle)

[NOTE]
This button can be activated using the
<<gmoccapy:jog-velocity,turtle-jog>> hal pin.

=== Advanced Settings

image::images/gmoccapy_settings_advanced.png[align="left"]

[[gmoccapy:tool-measurement]]

.Tool Measurement

If this part is not sensitive, you do not have a valid INI file configuration
to use tool measurement.

Please check <<gmoccapy:auto-tool-measurement, Auto Tool Measurement>>

* Use auto tool measurement : If checked, after each tool change, a tool
measurement will be done, the result will be stored in the tool table and an
G43 will be executed after the change.

.Probe Information

The following informations are taken from your INI file and must be given
in absolute coordinates

 * X Pos. = The X position of the tool switch
 * Y Pos. = The Y position of the tool switch
 * Z Pos. = The Z position of the tool switch, we will go as rapid move to 
 this coordinate

 * Max. Probe = is the distance to search for contact, an error will be
 launched, if no contact is given. The distance has to be given in relative
 coordinates, beginning the move from Z Pos., so you have to give a negative
 value to go down!

 * Probe Height = is the height of your probe switch, you can measure it.
 Just touch off the base where the probe switch is located and set that to
 zero. Then make a tool change and watch the tool_offset_z value, that is the
 hight you must enter here.

.Probe velocities

 * Search Vel. = The velocity to search for the tool switch, after contact
 the tool will go up again and then goes toward the probe again with probe
 vel, so you will get better results. 

 * Probe Vel. = Is the velocity for the second movement to the switch, it
 should be slower to get better touch results.(In sim mode, this is
 commented out in macros/change.ngc, otherwise the  user would have to click
 twice on the probe button)

.Tool Changer

If your 4'th axis is used in a tool changer, you may want to hide the DRO
and all the other buttons related to that axis.

You can do that by checking the checkbox, that will hide:

 * 4'th axis DRO
 * 4'th axis Jog button
 * 4'th axis home button
 * column of 4'th axis in the offsetpage
 * column of 4'th axis in the tooleditor

[[gmoccapy:reload-tool-on-start]]

If checked, the tool in spindle will be saved on each change in the preference 
file, making it possible to reload the last mounted tool on start up.
The tool will be loaded after all axis are homed, because before it is not
allowed to execute MDI commands. If you use NO_FORCE_HOMING you can not use
this feature, because the needed all_homed_signal will never be emitted.

[[gmoccapy:message-behavior]]

.Message Behavior And Appearance

This will display small pop up windows displaying the message or error text,
the behavior is very similar to the one axis uses. You can delete a specific
message, by clicking on it's close button, if you want to delete the last one,
just hit the WINDOWS key on your keyboard, or delete all messages at ones
with <STRG><SPACE>.

You are able to set some options:

 * X Pos = The position of the top left corner of the message in X counted
 in pixel from the top left corner of the screen.
 * Y Pos = The position of the top left corner of the message in Y counted
 in pixel from the top left corner of the screen.
 * Width = The width of the message box
 * max = The maximum messages you want to see at ones, if you set this to 10,
 the 11th message will delete the first one, so you will only see the last 10
 ones.
 * Font = The font and size you want to use to display the messages
 * use frames = If you activate the checkbox, each message will be displayed
 in a frame, so it is much easier to distinguish the messages. But you will
 need a little bit more space.
 * The button launch test message will just do what it is supposed to, it will
 show a message, so you can see the changes of your settings without the need
 to generate an error.

.Run From Line Option

You can allow or disallow the run from line. This will set the corresponding
button insensitive (grayed out), so the user will not be able to use this
option. The default is disable run from line.

[WARNING]
It is not recommend to use run from line, as LinuxCNC will not take care of
any previous lines in the code before the starting line. So errors or crashes
are very probable.


[[gmoccapy:lathe-section]]

== Lathe Specific Section

If in the INI File LATHE = 1 is given, the GUI will change its appearance
to the special needs for a lathe. Mainly the Y axis will be hidden and the
jog buttons will be arranged in a different order.

.Normal Lathe

image::images/gmoccapy_lathe.png[align="left"]

.Back Tool Lathe

image::images/gmoccapy_back_tool_lathe.png[align="left"]

As you see the R DRO has a black background and the D DRO is gray. This will
change according to the active G-Code G7 or G8. The active mode is visible by
the black background, meaning in the shown images G8 is active.

The next difference to the standard screen is the location of the Jog Button.
X and Z have changed places and Y is gone. You will note that the X+ and X-
buttons changes there places according to normal or back tool lathe.

Also the keyboard behavior will change:

Normal Lathe:

 * Arrow Left or NumPad_Left = Z minus
 * Arrow Right or NumPad_Right = Z plus
 * Arrow up or NumPad_Up = X minus
 * Arrow Down or NumPad_Down = X plus

Back Tool Lathe:

 * Arrow Left or NumPad_Left = Z minus
 * Arrow Right or NumPad_Right = Z plus
 * Arrow up or NumPad_Up = X plus
 * Arrow Down or NumPad_Down = X minus

The tool information frame will show not only the Z offset, but also the X
offset and the tool table is showing all lathe relevant information.

== Plasma Specific Section

== Video On You Tube

This are videos showing gmoccapy in action, unfortunately the videos don't
show the latest version of gmoccapy, but the way to use it will not change
much in the future. I will try to actualize the videos as soon as possible.

== Known problems 

=== Strange numbers in the info area

If you get strange numbers in the info area of gmoccapy like:

image::images/strange_numbers.png[align="left"]

You have made your config file using an older version of StepConfWizard.
It has made a wrong entry in the INI file under the [TRAJ] named
MAX_LINEAR_VELOCITY = xxx. Change that entry to MAX_VELOCITY = xxx 

=== Not ending macro [[sub:NOT_ENDING_MACROS]]

If you use a macro without movement, like this one:

---------
 o<zeroxy> sub

G92.1
G92.2
G40

G10 L20 P0 X0 Y0

o<zeroxy> endsub 
m2
---------

gmoccapy will not see the end of the macro, because the interpreter needs to 
change its state to IDLE, but the macro does not even set the interpreter to
a new state. To avoid that just add a G4 P0.1 line to get the needed signal. 
The correct macro would be:

---------
 o<zeroxy> sub

G92.1
G92.2
G40

G10 L20 P0 X0 Y0

G4 P0.1

o<zeroxy> endsub 
m2
---------
