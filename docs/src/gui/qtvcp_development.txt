= QTvcp Development

The intention of QtVCP is to supply an infrastructure to support +
screen and VCP panel building for linuxcnc. By supplying a diverse +
widget set and supporting custom coding, QtVCP hopes that development +
energy will be expended in one toolkit rather then continuous re-invention. +
By using the same toolkit across many screens/panels users should have an easier +
time customizing/creating and developers should find it easier to help +
trouble shoot with less effort. +

== Overview

QtVCP uses a QT Designer built .ui file and a python handler file +
to load and control a screen/panel that displays QT widgets to control +
linuxcnc's motion controller or HAL pins. +
There are builtin screens and panels, easily loaded by a user or +
A user can build/modify one of their own. +
QtVCP uses libraries and custom widgets to hide some of the complexity +
of interfacing to linuxcnc. By using QtVCP's library rather then linuxcnc's, +
We can mitigate minor linuxcnc code changes. +

== Builtin locations

Builtin screens and panels are stored in separate folders. +

 * screens in share/qtvcp/screens +
 * panels in share/qtvcp/panels +
 * Stock images are in share/qtvcp/images +

screens and panels are sorted by their folder name, which is +
also the name used to load them. +
Inside the folder would be the .ui file, the handler file and +
possibly the .qss theme file. +

== QtVCP startup to shutdown

QtVCP source is located in src/emc/usr_intf/qtvcp +

 * When QtVCP first starts, it must decide if this object is a screen +
or a panel. Then it searches for and collects information about +
paths of required files and useful folders. +
 * Next, it builds the HAL component, loads the window instance, +
adds handler extensions and installs an event filter. +
 * Now the window/widgets are instantiated, the HAL pins are built, +
which also initiates the '_init_hal()' function of the widgets. +
 * The handler function 'initialized__()' is called and then the STATUS +
library is forced to update. Hal component is set ready at this point. +
 * A variety of optional switch arguments are set, including calling a +
POSTGUI HAL file (if a screen). Terminate signals are trapped and +
QtVCP now polls for events. +
 * Finally when QtVCP is asked to shutdown, it calls shutdown functions +
in the handler file, shuts down STATUS monitoring and kills teh HAL +
component. +

== Path information

When QtVCP loads it collects Path information: +
This is available in the handler file's '__init__()' function +
as 'path' +

 * IMAGEDIR = Path of builtin images +
 * SCREENDIR = Path of builtin motion controller screens + 
 * PANELDIR = Path of builtin accessory panels +
 * WORKINGDIR = Path of where QtVCP was launched from +
 * CONFIGPATH = Path of the launched configuration +
 * BASEDIR = general path, used to derive all paths +
 * BASENAME = Generic name used to derive all paths + 
 * LIBDIR = Path of QtVCP's python library +
 * HANDLER = Path of handler file +
 * XML = Path of .ui file +
 * DOMAIN = Path of translation +
 * IS_SCREEN = screen/panel switch +

== Idiosyncrasies

These try to cover non-obvious situations.

=== Error code  collecting

Linuxcnc's error code collecting can only be read from one place. +
When read , it is 'consumed' - no other object can read it. +
In QtVCP screens, it is recommended to use the ScreenOptionss widget to +
set up error reading. They are then sent to other objects via STATUS +
signals.

=== Jog rate

Linuxcnc has no internal record of jog rate - you must specify it at the +
time of jogging. +
QtVCP uses the STATUS library to keep track of the latest linear and +
angular jog rate. It is always specified in machine units per minute, so must be +
converted when in non-machine units mode. +
So if your machine is imperial based but you are in metric mode +
changes to jog rate sent to ACTION functions must be converted to imperial. +
at the same time if the machine is metric based and you are in imperial mode, +
 changes to jog rate must be sent to ACTION functions in metric units. +
Angular jog rates the units don't change in metric/imperial +
mode so you can send them to ACTION functions without conversion. +
While you are free to ignore this jogging record while building screens, +
Anyone modifying your screen and using the builtin jog rate widgets would +
not get the desired results. The ACTION library's 'DO_JOG' function, gets +
it's jog rate from the STATUS library. +

=== Keybinding

Keybinding is always a difficult-to-get-right-in-all-cases affair. +
Custom keybinding functions are to be defined in the handler file. +
Most importantly widgets that require regular key input and not jogging, +
should be checked for in the 'processed_key_event__' function. +

=== Preference file

Some QtVCP widget use the preference file to record important information. +
This requires The preference file to be set up early in the widget +
initialization process. The easiest way to do this is to use the +
ScreenOptions widget.

=== Widget special setup functions

QtVCP looks for and calls the '_hal_init' function, when the widget +
is first loaded. It is not called when using Designer. +
After this function is called the widget has access to some special +
variables: +

[source,python]
----
        self.HAL_GCOMP = the HAL component instance
        self.HAL_NAME = This widgets name as a string
        self.QT_OBJECT_ = This widgets pyQt object instance
        self.QTVCP_INSTANCE_ = The very toplevel Parent Of the screen
        self.PATHS_ = The instance of QtVCP's path library
        self.PREFS_ = the instance of an optional preference file
----

When making a custom widget, import and sub class the +
'_HalWidgetBase' class:

=== Dialogs

Dialogs (AKA pop up windows) are placed on the screen in Designer. +
It doesn't matter where on the layout but to make them hidden, +
cycle the 'state' property to true then false. +
By default, if there is a preference file, the dialogs will +
rember their last size/placement. It is possible to override +
this so they open in the same location each time. +

=== Styles (Themes)

While it is possible to set styles in designer, it is more +
convenient to change them later if they are all set in a +
separate .qss file. The file should be put in the same +
location as the handler file.+
