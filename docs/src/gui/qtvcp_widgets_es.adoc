= QTvcp Widgets

Qtscreen uses QTvcp widgets for linuxcnc integration. +
Widget is the general name for the UI objects such as buttons and labels in QTpy. +
You are free to use any available widgets in the QTDesigner editor. +
There are also special widgets made for linuxcnc that make integration easier. +
This are split in two heading on the right side of the editor. +
One is for HAL only widgets. +
The other is for cnc control widgets. +
you are free to mix them in any way on your panel. +

[NOTE]

This description of widget properties can easily be out of date due to further development and +
lack of people to write docs (A good way to give back to the project). +
The definitive descriptions are found by looking in the source code. +

== HAL Only Widgets

These Widgets usually have HAL pins and don't react to the machine Controller

=== XEmbed Widget

Allows one to embed program into the widget. +
only programs that utilize the xembed protocol will work such as: +

* gladevcp virtual control panels
* Onboard virtual keyboard
* qtvcp virtual control panels
* mplayer video player

=== Slider Widget

Allows one to adjust a HAL pins using a sliding pointer. +

=== LED Widget

.LED

==== Text changes on state

Choosing the checked_state_text_option allows a 'checkable' button to change the text based +
on it's checked state. It uses the properties 'true_state_string' and 'false_state_string' +
to specify the text for each state. +

==== Call python commands on state

The python_command_option allow small snippets of python code to be run from the push of a button, +
with out having to edit the handler file. (though it can call functions in the handler file) +
When using the command_string properties. +
'true_python_cmd_string' - a python command that will be called when the button is toggled true +
'false_python_cmd_string' - a python command that will be called when the button is toggled false +
 +
The capitalized word 'INSTANCE' will give access to the widgets instances and handler functions. +
eg. 'INSTANCE.my_handler_function_call(True)' +
The capitalized word 'ACTION' will give access to qtvcp's ACTION library. +
eg. 'ACTION.TOGGLE_FLOOD()' +

=== WidgetSwitcher Widget

This is used to switch the view of a multi-widget layout to  show just one widget. +
This might be used to flip between a large view of a widget or a smaller multi widget view. +
I'ts different from a stacked widget as it can pull a widget from anywhere in the screen and +
place it in it's page with a different layout then it originally had. +
The original widget must be in a layout for switcher to put it back. +
 +
In Designer you will add the widgetswitcher widget on screen. +
Right click the widgetswitcher and add a page, +
then populate it with widgets/layouts you wish to see in a default form. +
Then add as many pages as there are views to switch to. +
on each page add a layout widget. +
After adding the layout you must right click the widget switcher again +
and set the layout option. +
click on the widgetswitcher widget and then scroll to the bottom of the property editor. +
you are looking for the dynamic property 'widget_list'. +
double click the to the right of the widget_list property. +
A dialog will pop up allowing you to add the names of the widgets to move to the pages you added to the widgetswitcher. +
 +
There are function calls to display specific widgets: +

 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_id_widget(number)
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_named_widget(widget_name)
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_default()
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_next()

By calling one of these functions, you control what widget +
is currently displayed. show_default() shows the page 0 +
layout, and puts all other widgets back to where they were as initially built in Designer. +



It is based on the QStack widget. +

== Machine Controller Widgets

'Calc' will pop up a calculator dialog. +
'Clear' clears th ecurrent entry. +
'Back' allows you to change previous line entries. +
 +
The widget requires an explicied call to MDITouchu's python code to actually run the MDI command +
For handler file code: if the widget was named mditouchy in designer, this command would +
run the displayed MDI command. +

[source,python]
----
self.w.mditouchy.run_command()
----

For action button use: if the widget was named mditouchy in designer, +
use the action button's 'Call python commands' option and enter: +
[source,python]
----
INSTANCE.mditouchy.run_command()
----

The macro button will cycle though macro's defined in the INI heading [DISPLAY] +
add one or more 'MACRO = ' lines.  Each should be of the format: +

[source,ini]
----
MACRO = increment xinc yinc
----
In this example, increment is the name of the macro, and it accepts two
parameters, named xinc and yinc.

Now, place the macro in a file named 'increment.ngc', in the +
'PROGRAM_PREFIX' directory or any directory in the 'SUBROUTINE_PATH'. +
(specified in the INI file) +

It should look like: +

----
O<increment> sub
G91 G0 X#1 Y#2
G90
O<increment> endsub
----

Notice the name of the sub matches the file name and macro name exactly, +
including case. +

When you invoke the macro by pressing the Macro button +
you can enter values for xinc and yinc.  These are +
passed to the macro as '#1' and '#2' respectively.  Parameters you +
leave empty are passed as value 0. +

If there are several different macros, press the Macro button +
repeatedly to cycle through them. +

In this simple example, if you enter -1 for xinc and invoke the running of the +
MDI cycle, a rapid 'G0' move will be invoked, moving one unit to +
the left. +

This macro capability is useful for edge/hole probing and other setup +
tasks, as well as perhaps hole milling or other simple operations +
that can be done from the panel without requiring specially-written +
gcode programs. +

== Dialog Widgets

Dialogs are used to present or request immediately required information in a focused way. +
The typical used dialogs can be loaded using the screenoptions widget. +
You can also add them directly to the ui - but each dialog must have a unique launch name +
or you will see multiple dialogs displayed, one after another. +
You can show dialogs directly with python code but a safer way is to use STATUS messages to +
request the dialog to launch and to return the gathered information. +

To set this up first register to catch the 'general' message from STATUS:
[source,python]
----
STATUS.connect('general',self.return_value)
----

Add a function to call a dialog: +
This function must build a message DICT to send to the dialog. +
This message will be passed back in the general message with the addition +
of the RETURN variable. It is possible to add extra user information to the message. +
The dialog will ignore these and pass them back. +
'NAME' = launch code name of dialog to show. +
'ID' = a unique id so we process only a dialog that we requested. +
'TITLE' = the title to use on the dialog

[source,python]
----
        def show_dialog(self):
            mess = {'NAME':'ENTRY','ID':'__test1__',
                    'TITLE':'Test Entry'}
            ACTION.CALL_DIALOG, mess)
----

Add a callback function that processes the general message: +
This function should check the the name and id is the same as +
we sent, then it can extract the return value and any user variables. +
Keep in mind this function will get all general messages so the DICT keynames +
are not guaranteed to be there. Using the .get() function and or using try/except +
is advisable.
[source,python]
----
    # process the STATUS return message
    def return_value(self, w, message):
        rtn = message.get('RETURN')
        code = bool(message.get('ID') == '__test1__')
        name = bool(message.get('NAME') == 'ENTRY')
        if code and name and not rtn is None:
            print ('Entry return value from {} = {}').format(code, rtn)
----
