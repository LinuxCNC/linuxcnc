== Introduction

Panelui is a non-realtime component to interface buttons to LinuxCNC or HAL:

* It decodes MESA 7I73 style key-scan codes and calls the appropriate routine.
* It gets input from a realtime component - sampler.  Sampler gets its input from either the MESA 7I73 or sim_matrix_kb component.
* Panelui is configurable using an INI style text file to define button types, HAL pin types, and/or commands.
* It can be extended using a Python based 'handler' file to add functions.

While actual input buttons are required to be momentary, Panelui will use this input to make toggle, radio, or momentary button output.

== Loading Commands

The command used to load panelui (with optional -d debug switch):

[source,{hal}]
----
loadusr -W panelui -d
----

This will initialize panelui, which will look for the INI file panelui.ini in
the config folder or user folder.

One can validate the INI file with this command:

[source,{hal}]
----
loadusr pyui
----

This will read, try to correct, then save the panelui.ini file.
It will print errors to the terminal if found.

A typical HAL file will have these commands added:

[source,{hal}]
----
# commands needed for panelui loading
#
# sampler is needed for panelui
# cfg= must always be u for panelui. depth sets the available buffer
loadrt sampler cfg=u depth=1025

#uncomment to validate the panelui INI file
#loadusr pyui

# -d = debug, -v = verbose debug
# -d will show you keypress identification and commands called
# -v is for develeper info
loadusr -W panelui -d

# using simulated buttons instead of the MESA 7I73 card
# so we load the sim_matrix_kb component to convert HAL pins to keyscan codes
loadrt sim_matrix_kb

# connect the components together.
# sampler talks to panelui internally
net key-scan    sim-matrix-kb.0.out
net key-scan    sampler.0.pin.0

# add panelui components to a thread

addf sim-matrix-kb.0    servo-thread
addf sampler.0          servo-thread
----

== panelui.ini file reference

.*Key words*
* KEY= This is used to designate the key that the button responds to. It can be NONE or
  ROW number and column number eg R1C2. A row and column can only be used once.
* OUTPUT= This sets the Button's output type, eg S32, U32, FLOAT, BIT, NONE, COMMAND, ZMQ.
* DEFAULT= This sets the starting output of the group or button.
* GROUP= In radiobuttons, designates the group the button interacts with.
* GROUP_OUTPUT= sets the output the group pin will be, if this button is active.
* STATUS_PIN= If TRUE, a HAL pin will be added that reflects the current state of button.
* TRUE_STATE= sets the output the HAL pin will be, if button is TRUE.
* FALSE_STATE= sets the OUTPUT the HAL pin will be, if the button is FALSE.
* TRUE_COMMAND= sets the command and arguments to be called when the button is TRUE.
* FALSE_COMMAND= sets the command and arguments to be called when the button is FALSE.
* TRUE_FUNCTION= sets the ZMQ message function and arguments to be called when the button is TRUE.
* FALSE_FUNCTION= sets the ZMQ message function and arguments to be called when the button is FALSE.

.*HAL Prefix*
[source,{ini}]
----
[HAL_PREFIX]
    NAME= Yourname
----

This allows one to change the prefix of the HAL pins from 'panelui' to an arbitrary name.

.*ZMQ Messaging Setup*
[source,{ini}]
----
[ZMQ_SETUP]
  TOPIC = 'QTVCP'
  SOCKET = 'tcp://127.0.0.1:5690'
  ENABLE = True
----

This sets up and enables ZMQ based messaging.
TOPIC and SOCKET must match the listening program.

.*Radio Buttons*
Radiobutons allow only one button in the group to be active at a time.
Each group has its own output pin, separate from each button in the group.
Radio button definitions start with the text 'RADIO_BUTTON' inside single brackets.

[source,{ini}]
----
[RADIO_BUTTONS]
  # The double bracket section(s) define the group(s) of radio buttons.
  # The group name must be unique and is case sensitive.
  # Groups output is controlled by what button is active not directly by keycode.
  # DEFAULT references a button in the group by name and is case sensitive.
  [[group1_name]]
    KEY = NONE
    OUTPUT = FLOAT
    DEFAULT = small
    # The triple bracket sections define the buttons in this group.
    # button names must be unique and are case sensitive.
    # There must be at least two buttons in a group.
    #
    # This button, named 'small'is controller by the row 0 column 1 key.
    # It will cause the group output to be .0001 when it is pressed.
    # It has no output of its own, but has a status
    # pin which will follow its current state.
    # since this button is in a group, DEFAULT has no bearing.
    # since OUTPUT in not 'COMMAND' _COMMAND entries are ignored.
    [[[small]]]
      KEY = R0C1
      GROUP = group1_name
      GROUP_OUTPUT = .0001
      OUTPUT = NONE
      STATUS_PIN = True
      TRUE_STATE = TRUE
      FALSE_STATE = FALSE
      TRUE_COMMAND = NONE, NONE
      FALSE_COMMAND = NONE, NONE
      DEFAULT = false
    # This button, named 'large' is controller by the row 0 column 2 key.
    # It will cause the group output to be 1000 when it is pressed.
    # It has a S32 output of its own, will be 20 on true and 0 on false.
    # It also has a status pin which will follow its current state.
    # since this button is in a group, DEFAULT has no bearing.
    # since OUTPUT in not 'COMMAND' _COMMAND entries are ignored.
    [[[large]]]
      KEY = R0C2
      GROUP = group1_name
      GROUP_OUTPUT = 1000
      OUTPUT = S32
      STATUS_PIN = True
      TRUE_STATE = 20
      TRUE_COMMAND = NONE, NONE
      FALSE_COMMAND = NONE, NONE
      FALSE_STATE = 0
      DEFAULT = false
----

.*Toggle Buttons*
Togglebuttons only change state on each press of the button.
Toggle button definitions start with the text 'TOGGLE_BUTTON' inside single brackets.

[source,{ini}]
----
[TOGGLE_BUTTONS]
  # Each button name inside double brackets, must be unique and is case sensitive.
  # This button, named 'tool_change'is controller by the row 2 column 5 key.
  # It has a BIT output, will output 1 on true state and 0 on false state.
  # It also has a status pin which will follow its current state.
  # DEFAULT sets this to true when first initialized.
  # The _COMMAND are not used since OUTPUT is not set to COMMAND but validation will
  # add the lines regardless
  [[tool_change]]
    KEY = R2C5
    OUTPUT = BIT
    TRUE_COMMAND = NONE, NONE
    FALSE_COMMAND = NONE, NONE
    STATUS_PIN = True
    DEFAULT = TRUE
    TRUE_STATE = 1
    FALSE_STATE = 0
----

.*Momentary Buttons*
Momentary buttons are true when pressed and false when released.
Momentary button definitions start with the text 'MOMENTARY_BUTTON' inside single brackets.

[source,{ini}]
----
[MOMENTARY_BUTTONS]
  # Each button name inside double brackets, must be unique and is case sensitive.
  # This button, named 'spindle_rev'is controller by the row 2 column 3 key.
  # It has a COMMAND output, so will use TRUE_COMMAND and FALSE_COMMAND.
  # It also has a status pin which will follow its current state.
  # COMMANDs will have a command name and then any required arguments
  # This TRUE_COMMAND calls an internal command to start the spindle in reverse at 200 rpm
  # If the spindle is already started, it will increase the rpm.
  # DEFAULT is not used with Momentary buttons.
  # The _STATE are not used since OUTPUT is set to COMMAND but validation will
  # add the lines regardless
  [[spindle_rev]]
    KEY = R2C3
    OUTPUT = COMMAND
    TRUE_COMMAND = SPINDLE_REVERSE_INCREASE, 200
    FALSE_COMMAND = None, NONE
    STATUS_PIN = True
    DEFAULT = FALSE
    TRUE_STATE = 1
    FALSE_STATE = 0

== ZMQ Messages

Panelui can send ZMQ based messages on button presses. +
In this way panelui can interact will other programs such as QtVCP screens. +

[source,{ini}]
----
[TOGGLE_BUTTONS]
  [[zmq_test]]
    KEY = R2C3
    OUTPUT = ZMQ
    TRUE_FUNCTION = ZMQ_BUTTON, 200
    FALSE_FUNCTION = ZMQ_BUTTON, 0
    STATUS_PIN = False
    DEFAULT = FALSE
    TRUE_STATE = 1
    FALSE_STATE = 0
----

Here is a sample program that will receive the message and print it to the terminal. +

[source,python]
----
import zmq
import json

# ZeroMQ Context
context = zmq.Context()

# Define the socket using the "Context"
sock = context.socket(zmq.SUB)

# Define subscription and messages with topic to accept.
topic = "" # all topics
sock.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, topic)
sock.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:5690")

while True:
    topic, message = sock.recv_multipart()
    print('{} sent message:{}'.format(topic,json.loads(message)))
----

== Handler File Extension

A special file can be used to add custom python code that will be available as commands.
panelui_handler.py must be written in python and be placed in the configuration folder.
If panelui finds a file there it will add its function calls to the available commands.
Here is an example of a handler file that adds two functions - hello_world and cycle_mode:

[source,python]
----
include::panelui_handler.py[]
----

// vim: set syntax=asciidoc:
