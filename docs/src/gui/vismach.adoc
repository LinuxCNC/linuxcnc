= Vismach

Vismach is a set of Python functions that can be used to create and
animate models of machines. Vismach displays the model in a 3D viewport
and the model parts are animated as the values of associated HAL pins
change.

The Vismach viewport view can be manipulated as follows:

* *zoom* by scroll wheel or right button drag,
* *pan* by left button drag,
* *rotate* by middle-button drag or shift-drag.

A Vismach model takes the form of a Python script and can use standard
Python syntax. This means that there is more than one way to lay out the
script, but in the examples given in this document I will use the
simplest and most basic of them.

The basic sequence in creating the Vismach model is

* Create the HAL pins that control the motion.
* Create the parts.
* Define how they move.
* Assemble into movement groups.

== Start the script

It is useful for testing to include the '#!/usr/bin/env python3' to
allow the file to be run as a script. The first thing to do is to import
the required libraries.

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from vismach import *
import hal
import math
import sys
----

== Create the HAL pins.

HAL pins are created with the normal Python "hal" library, and are not
specific to Vismach. Further details can be found in the
<<cha:halmodule,Creating Non-realtime Components in Python>> section.
A component should be created with a name that matches the script file
name and then the HAL pins are added to that component. They will be
referenced by their component handle and short name when used to animate
the Vismach model.

[source,python]
----
c = hal.component("samplegui")
c.newpin("joint0", hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN)
c.newpin("joint1", hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN)
c.ready()
----

Will create HAL pins 'samplegui.joint0' and 'samplegui.joint1'. When
loading the Vismach model with 'loadusr -W samplegui' the 'c.ready()'
function tells loadusr it's ready.

== Creating Parts

It is probably easiest to create geometry in a CAD package and *import*
into the model script with the `AsciiSTL()` or `AsciiOBJ()` functions.
Both functions can take one of two named arguments, either a filename
or raw data:

* `part = AsciiSTL(filename="path/to/file.stl") +
  part = AsciiSTL(data="solid part1 facet normal ....") +
  part = AsciiOBJ(filename="path/to/file.obj") +
  part = AsciiOBJ(data="v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0 ...")` +
  The parts will be created in the Vismach space in the same locations
  as they occupy in the STL or OBJ space. This means that it may be
  possible to assemble the model in the CAD package.

Alternatively parts can be created inside the model script from a range
of *shape primitives*. Many shapes are created at the origin and need to
be moved to the required location after creation:

* `cylinder = CylinderX(x1, r1, x2, r2) +
  cylinder = CylinderY(y1, r1, y2, r2) +
  cylinder = CylinderZ(z1, r1, z2, r2)` +
  Creates a (optionally tapered) cylinder on the given axis with the
  given radii at the given points on the axis.
* `sphere = Sphere(x, y, z, r)` +
  Creates a sphere of radius r at (x,y,z)
* `triangle = TriangleXY(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, z1, z2) +
  triangle = TriangleXZ(x1, z1, x2, z2, x3, z3, y1, y2) +
  triangle = TriangleYZ(y1, z1, y2, z2, y3, z3, x1, x2)` +
  Creates a triangular plate between planes defined by the last two
  values parallel to the specified plane, with vertices given by the
  three coordinate pairs.
* `arc = ArcX(x1, x2, r1, r2, a1, a2)` +
  Create an arc shape.
* `box = Box(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)` +
  Creates a rectangular prism with opposite corners at the specified
  positions and edges parallel to the XYZ axes.
* `box = BoxCentered(xw, yw, zw)` +
  Creates an xw by yw by zw box centred on the origin.
* `box = BoxCenteredXY(xw, yw, z)` +
  Creates a box of width xw / yw and height z.

Composite parts may be created by *assembling* these primitives either
at creation time or subsequently using `Collection()`:

[source,python]
----
part1 = Collection([Sphere(100,100,100,50), CylinderX(100,40,150,30)])
part2 = Box(50,40,75,100,75,100)
part3 = Collection([part2, TriangleXY(10,10,20,10,15,20,100,101)])
part4 = Collection([part1, part2])
----

== Moving Parts

Parts may need to be moved in the Vismach space to assemble the model.
They may also need to be moved to create the animation as the animation
rotation axis is created at the origin (but moves with the Part):

* `part1 = Translate([part1], x, y, z)` +
  Move part1 the specified distances in x, y and z.
* `part1 = Rotate([part1], theta, x, y, z)` +
  Rotate the part by angle theta about an axis between the origin and
  x, y, z.

== Animating Parts

To animate the model (controlled by the values of HAL pins) there are
two functions 'HalTranslate' and 'HalRotate'. For parts to move inside
an assembly they need to have their HAL motions defined before being
assembled with the "Collection" command. The rotation axis and
translation vector move with the part as it is moved by the vismach
script during model assembly, or as it moves in response to the HAL pins
as the model is animated:

* `part = HalTranslate([part], comp, "hal_pin", xs, ys, zs)` +
  The function arguments are:
** first a _collection/part_ which can be pre-created earlier in the
   script, or could be created at this point if preferred eg
   `part1 = HalTranslate([Box(....)], ...)`.
** The _HAL component_ is the next argument, i.e. the object returned by
   the `comp = hal.component(...)` command. After that is the name of
   the HAL in that will animate the motion, this needs to match an
   existing HAL pin that is part of the HAL component created earlier in
   the script.
** Then follow the _X, Y, Z scales_. +
   For a Cartesian machine created at 1:1 scale this would typically be
   1,0,0 for a motion in the positive X direction. +
   However if the STL file happened to be in cm and the machine was in
   inches, this could be fixed at this point by using 0.3937
   (1cm /2.54in) as the scale.
* `part = HalRotate([part], comp, "hal_pin", angle_scale, x, y, z)` +
  This command is similar in its operation to HalTranslate except that
  it is typically necessary to move the part to the origin first to
  define the axis.
** The _axis of rotation_ is from the origin point to the point defined
   by (x,y,z). +
   When the part is moved back away from the origin to its correct
   location the axis of rotation can be considered to remain "embedded"
   in the part.
** _Rotation angles_ are in degrees, so for a rotary joint with a 0-1
   scaling you would need to use an angle scale of 360.

== Assembling the model.

In order for parts to move together they need to be assembled with the
Collection() command. It is important to assemble the parts and define
their motions in the correct sequence. For example to create a moving
head milling machine with a rotating spindle and an animated draw bar
you would:

* Create the head main body.
* Create the spindle at the origin.
* Define the rotation.
* Move the head to the spindle or spindle to the head.
* Create the draw bar.
* Define the motion of the draw bar.
* Assemble the three parts into a head assembly.
* Define the motion of the head assembly.

In this example the spindle rotation is indicated by rotation of a set
of drive dogs:

[source,python]
----
#Drive dogs
dogs = Box(-6,-3,94,6,3,100)
dogs = Color([1,1,1,1],[dogs])
dogs = HalRotate([dogs],c,"spindle",360,0,0,1)
dogs = Translate([dogs],-1,49,0)

#Drawbar
draw = CylinderZ(120,3,125,3)
draw = Color([1,0,.5,1],[draw])
draw = Translate([draw],-1,49,0)
draw = HalTranslate([draw],c,"drawbar",0,0,1)

# head/spindle
head = AsciiSTL(filename="./head.stl")
head = Color([0.3,0.3,0.3,1],[head])
head = Translate([head],0,0,4)
head = Collection([head, tool, dogs, draw])
head = HalTranslate([head],c,"Z",0,0,0.1)

# base
base = AsciiSTL(filename="./base.stl")
base = Color([0.5,0.5,0.5,1],[base])
# mount head on it
base = Collection([head, base])
----

Finally a single collection of all the machine parts, floor and work (if
any) needs to be created:

* For a _serial machine_ each new part will be added to the collection of
  the previous part.
* For a _parallel machine_ there may be several "base" parts.

Thus, for example, in scaragui.py link3 is added to link2, link2 to
link1 and link1 to link0, so the final model is created by:

[source,python]
----
model = Collection([link0, floor, table])
----

Whereas a VMC model with separate parts moving on the base might have:

[source,python]
----
model = Collection([base, saddle, head, carousel])
----

== Other functions

* `part = Color([colorspec], [part])` +
  Sets the display color of the part. Note that unlike the other
  functions the part definition comes second in this case. +
  The colorspec consists of the three RGB values and an opacity.
  For example [1,0,0,0.5] for a 50% opacity red.
* `myhud = Hud()` +
  Creates a heads-up display in the Vismach GUI to display such items as
  axis positions.
////
Need to play around with this to see how it works.
////
* `part = Capture()` +
  I have no idea what this does ! But it seems to be important for tool
  tip visualization...
* `main(model, tooltip, work, size=10, hud=0, rotation_vectors=None,
  lat=0, lon=0)` +
  This is the command that makes it all happen, creates the display etc.
** _model_ should be a collection that contains all the machine parts.
** _tooltip_ and _work_ need to be created by `Capture()` to visualize
   their motion in the back plot. +
   See `scaragui.py` for an example of how to connect the tool tip to a
   tool and the tool to the model.
** Either _rotation_vectors_ or _latitude/longitude_ can be used to set
   the original viewpoint and it is advisable to do as the default
   initial viewpoint is rather unhelpfully from immediately overhead.
** _size_ sets the extent of the volume visualized in the initial view.
** _hud_ refers to a head-up display of axis positions.
