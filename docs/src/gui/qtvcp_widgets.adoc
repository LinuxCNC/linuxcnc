= QTvcp Widgets

Qtscreen uses QTvcp widgets for linuxcnc integration. +
Widget is the general name for the UI objects such as buttons and labels in QTpy. +
You are free to use any available widgets in the QTDesigner editor. +
There are also special widgets made for linuxcnc that make integration easier. +
This are split in two heading on the right side of the editor. +
One is for HAL only widgets. +
The other is for cnc control widgets. +
you are free to mix them in any way on your panel. +

[NOTE]

This description of widget properties can easily be out of date due to further development and +
lack of people to write docs (A good way to give back to the project). +
The definitive descriptions are found by looking in the source code. +

== HAL Only Widgets

These Widgets usually have HAL pins and don't react to the machine Controller

=== XEmbed Widget

Allows one to embed program into the widget. +
only programs that utilize the xembed protocol will work such as: +

* gladevcp virtual control panels
* Onboard virtual keyboard
* qtvcp virtual control panels
* mplayer video player

=== Slider Widget

Allows one to adjust a HAL pins using a sliding pointer. +

=== LED Widget

.LED
image::images/qtvcp_ledWidget.png["QTvcp led",scale="25%"]

An indicator that optionally follows a HAL pin's logic. +

* halpin_option -selects if the LED follows an input HAL pin or program state.
* diameter -diameter of the LED
* color - Color of the LED when on.
* off_color - Color of the LED when off.
* alignment - Qt Alignment hint.
* state -current state of LED
* flashing -turns flashing option on and off.
* flashRate -sets the flash rate.

The LED properties can be defined in a stylesheet with the following code added to the .qss file. +
The name_of_led would be the name defined Designer's editor. +

----
LED #name_0f_led{
qproperty-color: red;
qproperty-diameter: 20;
qproperty-flashRate: 150;
}
----

=== Checkbox Widget

This widget allows the user to check a box to set a HAL pin true or false. +

It is based on pyQT's QCheckButton

=== Radio Button Widget

This widget allows a user to set HAL pins true or false. +
Only one widget of a group can be true at a time. +

It is based on pyQT's QRadioButton

=== Round Gauge

.Round Gauge
image::images/qtvcp_round_gauge.png["QTvcp round gauge",scale="25%"]

Round Gauge can be used in a linuxcnc GUI to display an input parameter on the dial face.
There are several properties that are user settable in order to customize the appearance of the gauge.

There are 2 inputs that are not customizable. They can be set via HAL pins, programmatically or via signals from other widgets.
The non customizable parameters are:

* 'Value' -
This is the input value that will be displayed with the gauge needle and in the digital readout.
It must be set to a value between 0 and the maximum value.

* 'Setpoint' -
This is a value that determines the location of a small marker on the gauge face. 
It must be set to a value between 0 and the maximum value.


The following parameters can be set either programmatically or via the designer property editor. +
The custom parameters are:

* 'halpin_option' -
Setting this True will create 2 HAL pins. One is for setting the value input and the other is for setting the setpoint.
If this option is not set, then value and setpoint must be connected programmatically, ie., in the handler file.

* 'max_reading' -
This value determines the highest number that will be displayed on the gauge face.

* 'max_value' -
This is the maximum expected value of the value input signal. In other words, it is the full scale input.

* 'num_ticks' -
This is the number of ticks, or gauge readings that will be displayed on the gauge face.
It should be set to a number that ensures the text readings around the gauge face are readable.
The minimum allowed value is 2.

* 'zone1_color' -
Zone1 extends from the maximum reading to the threshold point. It can be set to any RGB color.

* 'zone2_color' -
Zone2 extends from the threshold point to the minimum reading, which is 0. It can be set to any RGB color.

* 'bezel_color' -
This is the color of the outer ring of the gauge.

* 'threshold' -
The threshold is the transition point between the zones. It should be set to a value between 0 and the maximum value.
The maximum allowed value is set to the gauge maximum value and minimum value is 0.

* 'gauge_label' -
This is the text that appears below the value readout, near the bottom of the gauge.
The function of the gauge is then easily visible.

=== HALPad

.HALPAD
image::images/qtvcp_HALPad.png["QTvcp HAL button Joypad ",scale="25%"]

----

The some indicator_status_options holds a property that can be used with a stylesheet +
to change the color of the button based on the state of the property in linuxcnc. +
Currently these status options can be used to auto style buttons: +
is_estopped_status indicated buttons change the property 'isEstopped' +
is_on_status indicated buttons change the property 'isStateOn' +
manual,mdi,auto _status indicated buttons change the properties 'isManual, isMDI, isAuto'

Here is a sample stylesheet entry. +
It sets the background of mode button widgets when linuxcnc is in that mode. +

----
ActionButton[isManual=true] {
    background: red;
}
ActionButton[isMdi=true] {
    background: blue;
}
ActionButton[isAuto=true] {
    background: green;
}
----

Here is how you specify a particular widget - by it's objectName in designer. +

----
ActionButton #estop button [isEstopped=false] {
    color: yellow;
}
----

==== Text changes on state

Choosing the checked_state_text_option allows a 'checkable' button to change the text based +
on it's checked state. It uses the properties 'true_state_string' and 'false_state_string' +
to specify the text for each state. +
'\\n' will be converted to a newline.

You can set/change these in style sheets: +

----
ActionButton #action_aux{
qproperty-true_state_string: "Air\\nOn";
qproperty-false_state_string: "Air\\nOff";
}
----

==== Call python commands on state

The python_command_option allow small snippets of python code to be run from the push of a button, +
with out having to edit the handler file. (though it can call functions in the handler file) +
When using the command_string properties. +
'true_python_cmd_string' - a python command that will be called when the button is toggled true +
'false_python_cmd_string' - a python command that will be called when the button is toggled false +
 +
The capitalized word 'INSTANCE' will give access to the widgets instances and handler functions. +
eg. 'INSTANCE.my_handler_function_call(True)' +
The capitalized word 'ACTION' will give access to qtvcp's ACTION library. +
eg. 'ACTION.TOGGLE_FLOOD()' +
The capitalized word 'PROGRAM_LOADER' will give access to qtvcp's PROGRAM_LOADER library. +
eg. 'PROGRAM_LOADER.load_halshow()' +
The capitalized word 'HAL' will give access to HAL's python module. +

This widget can be controller with STATUS messages. +

=== Grid Layout Widget

This widget controls if the widgets inside it are enabled or disabled. +
disabled widgets are typically a different colour and do not respond to actions. +

It is based on pyQT's QGridLayout

=== HAL Label Widget
This widget displays values sent to it from HAL pins, programically or a QtSignal. +
The input pin can be selected as Bit, S32, Float or no pin selected. +
There is a text Template property to set the rich text and/or to format the text. +
Basic formatting might be, for bool: %r, for integer: %d, for float: %0.4f. +
A rich text example might be:

[source,python]
----
self.w.my_hal_label.setProperty(textTemplate,"""
<html><head/><body><p><span style=" font-size:12pt;
font-weight:600; color:#f40c11;">%0.4f</span></p></body></html>
""")

----
The 'setDisplay' slot can be connected to a integer, float or bool signal. +
If the property 'pin_name' is not set the widget name will be used. +

There are function calls to display values: +

* [HALLabelName].setDisplay(some_value) can be used to set the display if no HAL pin is selected.
* [HALLabelName].setProperty(textTemplate,"%d") - set the template of the display.

It is based on pyQT's QLabel

=== LCD Number Widget

This widget displays HAL float/s32/bit values in a LCD looking way. +
It can display numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, binary and octal formats 
by setting the property 'mode'. +
When using floats you can set a formatting string. +
You must set the property 'digitCount' to an appropriate setting to display the largest number. +

==== Properties 

* 'pin_name': +
Option string to be used as the HAL pin name. If set to an empty string the widget name will be used. +
* 'bit_pin_type': +
Selects the input pin as type BIT.
* 's32_pin_type': +
Selects the input pin as type S32.
* 'float_pin_type': +
Selects the input pin as type FLOAT.
* 'floatTemplate': +
A string that will be used as a python3 format template to tailor the LCD display. +
Only used when a FLOAT pin is selected. +
eg '{:.2f}' will display a float rounded to 2 numbers after the decimal. +
A blank setting will allow the decimal to move as required. +

It is based on pyQT's QLCDNumber

=== DoubleScale Widget
This widget is a spin button entry widget. +
used for setting a s32 and float HAL pin. +
It has an internal scale factor, set to a default of 1, that can be set programmically or using a QtSignal. +
The scale defaults to 1 +
he 'setInput' slot can be connected to a integer, or float signal. +

There is a function call to change the internal scaling factor: +

* [HALLabelName].setInput(some_value)

The HAL pins will be set to the value of the internal scale times the widget displayed value. +

=== CamView Widget

This widget displays a image from a web camera. +
It overlays an adjustable circular and cross hair target over the image. +
Camview was built with precise visual positioning in mind. +

=== GeneralHALInput Widget

This widget is used to connect an arbitrary QT widget to HAL using signals/slots. +
It is used for widgets that should respond to HAL pin changes. +

=== GeneralHALOutput Widget

This widget is used to connect an arbitrary QT widget to HAL using signals/slots. +
It is used for widgets that should control HAL pins. +

=== WidgetSwitcher Widget

This is used to switch the view of a multi-widget layout to  show just one widget. +
This might be used to flip between a large view of a widget or a smaller multi widget view. +
I'ts different from a stacked widget as it can pull a widget from anywhere in the screen and +
place it in it's page with a different layout then it originally had. +
The original widget must be in a layout for switcher to put it back. +
 +
In Designer you will add the widgetswitcher widget on screen. +
Right click the widgetswitcher and add a page, +
then populate it with widgets/layouts you wish to see in a default form. +
Then add as many pages as there are views to switch to. +
on each page add a layout widget. +
After adding the layout you must right click the widget switcher again +
and set the layout option. +
click on the widgetswitcher widget and then scroll to the bottom of the property editor. +
you are looking for the dynamic property 'widget_list'. +
double click the to the right of the widget_list property. +
A dialog will pop up allowing you to add the names of the widgets to move to the pages you added to the widgetswitcher. +
 +
There are function calls to display specific widgets: +

 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_id_widget(number)
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_named_widget(widget_name)
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_default()
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_next()

By calling one of these functions, you control what widget +
is currently displayed. show_default() shows the page 0 +
layout, and puts all other widgets back to where they were as initially built in Designer. +



It is based on the QStack widget. +

== Machine Controller Widgets

These widgets interact to the Machine Controller state.

=== Action Button Widget

These buttons are used to control action of the machine controller. +
They are built on top of indicator_buttons so can have LEDs overlaid. +

Indicated PushButtons and Actionbuttons are based on pyQT's QPushButton

=== ActionToolButton

Action tool  buttons are similar in concept to action buttons, but they use QToolButtons to allow +
optional actions to be selected by pushing and holding the button till the option menu pops up. +

Currently there is only one option - user view +

It is based on pyQT's QToolButton

==== User View

User view tool button allows a user to record and return to a arbitrary graphics view. +
Press and hold the button to have the menu pop up and press 'record view'. +
This records the currently displayed graphics view. +
click the button normally to return to the last recorded position. +
 +
The position recorded position will be remembered at shutdown if a preference file option is set up. +

[NOTE]
Do to programming limitations, the recorded position may not show exactly the same, +
Particularly if you pan zoomed out and pan again zoomed in while setting the desired view. +
Best practice is to select a main view, modify as desired, record, then immediately +
click the button to 'return' to the recorded position. If it is not as you like, +
modify it's existing position and re-record.

=== RoundButton

Round buttons work the same as ActionButtons other then the button is cropped round. +
They are intended only to be visually different. +
They have two path properties for displaying images on true and false. +

=== Axis Tool Button
This allows one to select and set an AXIS.
If the button is set checkable, it will indicate which axis is selected. +
If you press and hold the button a pop up menu will show allowing one to: +

* Zero the axis
* divide the axis by 2
* set the axis arbitrarily
* reset the axis to the last number recorded

You select the axis by setting the joint number +
You can select a halpin option that is set true when the axis is selected +

It is based on pyQT's QToolButton

=== Camview Widget
This is used to align the work piece or zero part features using a webcam. +
It uses opencv vision library. +

===  DRO_Label Widget
This will display the current position of an axis. +

* Qjoint_number - joint number of offset to display (10 will specify rotational offset)
* Qreference_type - actual, relative or distance to go (0,1,2)
* metric_template - format of display ie '%10.3f'
* imperial_template - format of display ie '%9.4f'
* angular_template  - format of display ie '%Rotational: 10.1f'

The DRO_Label widget holds a property 'isHomed' that can be used with a stylesheet +
to change the color of the DRO_Label based on home state of the joint number in linuxcnc. +

Here is a sample stylesheet entry. +
It sets the font of all DRO_Label widgets. +
It sets the text template (to set resolution) of the DRO +
Then sets the text color based on the Qt 'isHomed' Property. +

----
DROLabel {
    font: 25pt "Lato Heavy";
qproperty-imperial_template: '%9.4f';
qproperty-metric_template: '%10.3f';
qproperty-angular_template: '%11.2f';
}

DROLabel[isHomed=false] {
    color: red;
}

DROLabel[isHomed=true] {
  color: green;
}
----

Here is how you specify a particular widget - by it's objectName in designer. +

----
DROLabel #dr0_x_axis [isHomed=false] {
    color: yellow;
}
----

It is based on pyQT's QLabel

=== GcodeDisplay
This displays Gcode in text form. It will highlight the currently running line. +
This can also display MDI history when linuxcnc is in MDI mode. +
This can also display log entries when linuxcnc is in MANUAL mode. +
This will also display preference file entries if you enter 'PREFERENCE' in capitals +
into the MDILine widget. +
It has a signal percentDone(int) that that can be connected to a slot (such as a +
progressBar to display percent run)


* auto_show_mdi_status
Set true to have the widget switch to MDI history when in MDI mode

* auto_show_manual_status
Set true to have the widget switch to machine log when in Manual mode

The GcodeDisplay properties can be set in a stylesheet with the following code added to the .qss file. +

----
EditorBase{
qproperty-styleColorBackground: lightblue;
qproperty-styleColor0: black;
qproperty-styleColor1: #000000; /* black */
qproperty-styleColor2: red;

==== Setting Properties Programically

The screen designer chooses the default settings of the screenOptions widget. +
Once chosen, most won't ever need to be changed. +
but if needed some can be changed in the handler file or in stylesheets. +
Some settings are only checked on startup so will not cause changes after startup. +
In these cases you would need to make the changes in Qtdesigner only. +

ie. In the handler file +
Here we reference the widget by the QtDesigner user defined name: +
[source,python]
----
# red,green,blue,alpha 0-255
color = QtGui.QColor(0, 255, 0, 191)
self.w.screen_options.setProperty('close_overlay_color', color)
self.w.screen_options.setProperty('play_sounds_option',False)
----

ie. In style sheets +
Here we can reference the widget by QtDesigner user defined name +
or by widget class name. +
 
----
/* red, green, blue 0-255, alpha 0-100% or 0.0 to 1.0 */
/* the # sign is used to refer to QtDesigner defined widget name */
/* matches/applied to only this named widget */

#screen_options {
qproperty-close_overlay_color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.75) }
----
----
/* red, green, blue 0-255, alpha 0-100% or 0.0 to 1.0 */
/* use widget class name - matches/applied to all widgets of this class*/

ScreenOptions {
qproperty-close_overlay_color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.75) }
----

==== Preference File Entries

If the preference file option is selected, screenOption widget will make an INI based preference file. +

It uses images for visual representation of the macro and for an icon. +
It searches for special macros using the INI definition: +
[source,INI]
----
[RS274NGC]
SUBROUTINE_PATH = 
----
The macros are Oword subroutine with special comments to work with the launcher. +
The first three lines must have the keywords: (The forth is optional) +
Here is a sample for the first four lines in an Oword file: +
----
; MACROCOMMAND=Entry1,Entry2
; MACRODEFAULTS=0,true
; MACROIMAGE=my_image.svg,Icon layer number, Macro layer number 
; MACROOPTIONS=load:yes,save:yes,default:default.txt,path:~/macros
----

==== MACROCOMMAND

This is the first line in the Oword file. +
It is a comma separated list of text to display above an entry. +
There will be one for every variable required in the Oword function. +
If the macro does not require variables, only add '; MACROCOMMAND='

==== MACRODEFAULT

This must be the second line in the Oword file. +
It is a comma separated list of the default values for each variable in the Oword function. +
If you use the word 'true' or 'false' in the list, a checkbutton will be shown.

==== MACROIMAGE

This must be the third line in the Oword file. +
if using a SVG image file, the must end b .svg +
The image must be added to an svg layer. +
It uses layers to define different images for macro and icon. +
The first entry will be the SVG image file name. +
It is assumed to be in the same folder as the Oword file. +
The second item will be the image layer. +
the optional third entry will be the icon layer. +
If the third entry is missing, the same image will be used for macro and icon. +

If using a png/jpg image file . +
The first entry is the image filename. +
It is assumed the image file are in the same folder an the macro. +
The optional second entry will be the icon filename. +
If the second entry is missing the same image will be used for macro and image. +

If the keyword is present but the entries are missing , no images will be used. +

==== MACRODEFAULT
This optional line must be the forth line in the Oword file. +
It is a comma separated list of keyword and data. +

 * 'LOAD:yes' - show a load button
 * 'SAVE:yes' -show a save button

=== MDILine Widget

One can enter MDI commands here. A popup keyboard is available +
There are also embedded commands available from this Widget. +

Type, in all capitals, any of these commands to load the respective program: +

* HALMETER +
* HALSHOW +
* HALSCOPE +
* STATUS +
* CALIBRATION +
* CLASSICLADDER +
* PREFERENCE - Loads the preference file onto the gcodeEditor +

The history is recorded on a file defined in the INI. +
under the heading [DISPLAY] (this shows the default) +

[source,ini]
----
MDI_HISTORY_FILE = '~/.axis_mdi_history'
----

=== MDITouchy

.MDI Touchy
image::images/qtvcp_mdiTouchy.png["QTvcp MDI Touchy",scale="25%"]

This widget display button and entry lines for use with entering MDI commands. +
It is based on Linuxcnc's Touchy screen's MDI entry process. +
It's large buttons are most useful for touch screens. +
 +
To use MDITouchy, first press one of the 'G/XY', 'G/RO', 'M' or 'T' button. +
On the left, will show the current line that can be filled out, then press 'Next' for the next line. +
'Calc' will pop up a calculator dialog. +
'Clear' clears th ecurrent entry. +
'Back' allows you to change previous line entries. +
 +
The widget requires an explicied call to MDITouchu's python code to actually run the MDI command +
For handler file code: if the widget was named mditouchy in designer, this command would +
run the displayed MDI command. +

[source,python]
----
self.w.mditouchy.run_command()
----

For action button use: if the widget was named mditouchy in designer, +
use the action button's 'Call python commands' option and enter: +
[source,python]
----
INSTANCE.mditouchy.run_command()
----

The macro button will cycle though macro's defined in the INI heading [DISPLAY] +
add one or more 'MACRO = ' lines.  Each should be of the format: +

[source,ini]
----
MACRO = increment xinc yinc
----
In this example, increment is the name of the macro, and it accepts two
parameters, named xinc and yinc.

Now, place the macro in a file named 'increment.ngc', in the +
'PROGRAM_PREFIX' directory or any directory in the 'SUBROUTINE_PATH'. +
(specified in the INI file) +

It should look like: +

----
O<increment> sub
G91 G0 X#1 Y#2
G90
O<increment> endsub
----

Notice the name of the sub matches the file name and macro name exactly, +
including case. +

When you invoke the macro by pressing the Macro button +
you can enter values for xinc and yinc.  These are +
passed to the macro as '#1' and '#2' respectively.  Parameters you +
leave empty are passed as value 0. +

If there are several different macros, press the Macro button +
repeatedly to cycle through them. +

In this simple example, if you enter -1 for xinc and invoke the running of the +
MDI cycle, a rapid 'G0' move will be invoked, moving one unit to +
the left. +

This macro capability is useful for edge/hole probing and other setup +
tasks, as well as perhaps hole milling or other simple operations +
that can be done from the panel without requiring specially-written +
gcode programs. +

This widget will display and allows one to modify tool offsets +
It will update linuxcnc's tool table for changes made or found. +
The tool settings can only be changed in linuxcnc after homing and +
when the motion controller is idle. +
The display and entry will change between metric and imperial based +
on linuxcnc's current G20/G21 setting. +
The current in-use tool will be highlighted +
The current selected tool will be highlighted in a different color. +
The checkbox beside each tool can be used to select a tool(s) for an action. +
This action depends on extra code added either to a combined widget like +
tooloffsetview dialog or the screens handler code. +
Typical actions are 'load selected tool', 'delete selected tools' +
Clicking on the columns and rows allows one to adjust the settings. +
A dialog can be made to popup for data or text entry. +
The comments section will typically be displayed in the manual tool change dialog. +
If using a lathe configuration, there can be columns for X and Z wear. +
To use these columns to adjust the tool for wear, requires a remapped tool change +
routine. +

== Dialog Widgets

Dialogs are used to present or request immediately required information in a focused way. +
The typical used dialogs can be loaded using the screenoptions widget. +
You can also add them directly to the ui - but each dialog must have a unique launch name +
or you will see multiple dialogs displayed, one after another. +
You can show dialogs directly with python code but a safer way is to use STATUS messages to +
request the dialog to launch and to return the gathered information. +

To set this up first register to catch the 'general' message from STATUS:
[source,python]
----
STATUS.connect('general',self.return_value)
----

Add a function to call a dialog: +
This function must build a message DICT to send to the dialog. +
This message will be passed back in the general message with the addition +
of the RETURN variable. It is possible to add extra user information to the message. +
The dialog will ignore these and pass them back. +
'NAME' = launch code name of dialog to show. +
'ID' = a unique id so we process only a dialog that we requested. +
'TITLE' = the title to use on the dialog

[source,python]
----
        def show_dialog(self):
            mess = {'NAME':'ENTRY','ID':'__test1__',
                    'TITLE':'Test Entry'}
            ACTION.CALL_DIALOG, mess)
----

Add a callback function that processes the general message: +
This function should check the the name and id is the same as +
we sent, then it can extract the return value and any user variables. +
Keep in mind this function will get all general messages so the DICT keynames +
are not guaranteed to be there. Using the .get() function and or using try/except +
is advisable.
[source,python]
----
    # process the STATUS return message
    def return_value(self, w, message):
        rtn = message.get('RETURN')
        code = bool(message.get('ID') == '__test1__')
        name = bool(message.get('NAME') == 'ENTRY')
        if code and name and not rtn is None:
            print ('Entry return value from {} = {}').format(code, rtn)
----
