= QTvcp Widgets

Qtscreen uses QTvcp widgets for linuxcnc integration. +
Widget is the general name for the UI objects such as buttons and labels in QTpy. +
You are free to use any available widgets in the QTDesigner editor. +
There are also special widgets made for linuxcnc that make integration easier. +
This are split in two heading on the right side of the editor. +
One is for HAL only widgets. +
The other is for cnc control widgets. +
you are free to mix them in any way on your panel. +

== HAL Only Widgets

These Widgets usually have HAL pins and don't react to the machine Controller

=== XEmbed Widget

Allows one to embed program into the widget. +
only programs that utilize the xembed protocol will work such as: +

* gladevcp virtual control panels
* Onboard virtual keyboard
* qtvcp virtual control panels
* mplayer video player

=== Slider Widget

Allows one to adjust a HAL pins using a sliding pointer. +

=== LED Widget

An indicator that follows a HAL pin's logic

=== Checkbox Widget

This widget allows the user to check a box to set a HAL pin true or false. +

It is based on pyQT's QCheckButton

=== Radio Button Widget

This widget allows a user to set HAL pins true or false. +
Only one widget of a group can be true at a time. +

It is based on pyQT's QRadioButton

=== Push Button Widget

This widget allows a user to set a HAL pin true or false. +
as an option it can be a toggle button. +

It is based on pyQT's QpushButton

=== Focus Overlay Widget

This widget places a coloured overlay over the screen usually while a dialog is showing. +
Used to create a 'focused' feel and to draw attention to critical information. +
It can also show a translucent image. +
It can also display message text and buttons. +
This widget can be controller with STATUS messages. +

=== Grid Layout Widget

This widget controls if the widgets inside it are enabled or disabled. +
disabled widgets are typically a different colour and do not respond to actions. +

It is based on pyQT's QGridLayout

=== LCD Number Widget

This widget displays HAL float values in a LCD looking way. +

It is based on pyQT's QLCDNumber

=== CamView Widget

This widget displays a image from a web camera. +
It overlays an adjustable circular and cross hair target over the image. +
Camview was built with precision visually positioning in mind. +

=== GeneralHALInput Widget

This widget is used to connect an arbitrary QT widget to HAL using signals/slots. +
It is used for widgets that should respond to HAL pin changes. +

=== GeneralHALOutput Widget

This widget is used to connect an arbitrary QT widget to HAL using signals/slots. +
It is used for widgets that should control HAL pins. +

=== WidgetSwitcher Widget

This is used to switch the view of a multi-widget layout to  show just one widget. +
This might be used to flip between a large view of a widget or a smaller multi widget view. +
In Designer, you must right click the widget to create an initial page. +
Then populate it with widgets/layouts you wish to see in a default form. +
Then in the property 'widget list' specify widgets names that will be +
displayed in their own singular view. +
There are function calls to display specific widgets: +

 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_id_widget(number)
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_named_widget(widget_name)
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_default()
 * [WidgetSwitcherName].show_next()

By calling one of these functions, you control what widget +
is currently displayed. A default layout shows the combined +
layout, initially built in Designer. +

It is based on the QStack widget. +

== Machine Controller Widgets

These widgets interact to the Machine Controller state.

=== Action Button Widget

These buttons are used to control action of the machine controller. +

[NOTE]
If you right click on this widget you can launch a dialog +
to set any of these action. The dialogs will help to set the +
right related data to the selected action. +

Action buttons are subclasssed from indicated_PushButton +

Indicated PushButtons have three options: +

* indicator_option
* indicator_HAL_pin_option
* checked_state_text_option
* python_command_option

Indicator_option puts a triangle 'LED' on the top right corner of the button. +
It will indicated the current state of the button. Use the properties +
'on_state_color', 'off_state_color', and 'indicator_size' to customized the indicator. +

Indicator_HAL_pin_option will add a halpin, using the button name + '-led', that controls the +
button indicator state. +

Checked_state_text_option allows a checkable button to change the text based +
on it's checked state. It uses the properties 'true_state_string' and 'false_state_string' +
to specify the text for each state. +

Python_command_option allow small snippets of python code to be run from the push of a button, +
with out having to edit the handler file. (though it can call functions in the handler file) +
When using the command_string properties. +
'true_python_cmd_string' - a python command that will be called when the button is toggled true +
'false_python_cmd_string' - a python command that will be called when the button is toggled false +
 +
The capitalized word 'INSTANCE' will give access to the widgets instances and handler functions. +
eg. 'INSTANCE.my_handler_function_call(True)' +
The capitalized word 'ACTION' will give access to qtvcp's ACTION library. +
eg. 'ACTION.TOGGLE_FLOOD()' +
The capitalized word 'PROGRAM_LOADER' will give access to qtvcp's PROGRAM_LOADER library. +
eg. 'PROGRAM_LOADER.load_halshow()' +

===  Dialog entry

This is a dialog to display an edit line for information entry, such as origin offset. +
It returns the entry via STATUS messages using a python DICT. +
The DICT contains at minimum, the name of the dialog requested and an id code. +
The code name for this dialog is 'ENTRY' +
 +
To set this up first register to catch the 'general' message from STATUS:
[source,python]
----
STATUS.connect('general',self.return_value)
----

Add a function to call a dialog: +
This function must build a message DICT to send to the dialog. +
This message will be passed back in the general message with the addition +
of the RETURN varaible. It is possible to add extra user information to the message. +
The dialog will ignore these and pass them back. +
'NAME' = code name of dialog to show. +
'ID' = a unique id so we process only an entry that we requested. +
'TITLE' = the title to use on the dialog

[source,python]
----
        def show_dialog(self):
            mess = {'NAME':'ENTRY','ID':'__test1__',
                    'TITLE':'Test Entry'}
            STATUS.emit('dialog-request', mess)
----

Add a callback function that processes the general message:
This function should check the the name and id is the same as +
we sent, then it can extract the return value and any user variables. +
Keep in mind this function will get all general messages so the DICT keynames +
are not guaranteed to be there. Using the .get() function and or using try/except +
is advisable.
[source,python]
----
    # process the STATUS return message
    def return_value(self, w, message):
        rtn = message.get('RETURN')
        code = bool(message.get('ID') == '__test1__')
        name = bool(message.get('NAME') == 'ENTRY')
        if rtn and code and name:
            Print ('Entry return value from {} = {}').format(code, rtn)


----

It is based on pyQT's QDialog
