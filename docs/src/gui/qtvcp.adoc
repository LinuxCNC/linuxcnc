= Qtvcp

Qtvcp is an infrastructure to display a custom CNC screen or control panel in LinuxCNC. +
It displays a UI file built with the QTDesigner screen editor or combines this +
with python programming to create a GUI screen for running a CNC machine. +
Qtvcp is completely customizable - you can add different buttons and status LEDs etc. +
or add python code for even finer grain customization. +

[[sec:qtvcp-overview]](((QtVcp Overview)))

== Overview

There are two files that can be used, individually or in combination to add +
customization. +
A UI file that is made with QT's Designer graphical editor. +
A handler file which is a text file with python code. +
Normally qtvcp uses the stock UI and handler file. +
You can specify qtvcp to use 'local' UI and handler files. +
A 'local' file is one that is in the configuration folder that defines the +
rest of the machine's requirements. +
One is not restricted to adding a custom panel on the right or a custom tab. +
qtvcp leverages 'QT Designer' (the editor) and 'PyQT5' (the widget toolkit). +
QTvcp has some special widgets and actions added just for LinuxCNC. +
There are special widgets to bridge third party widgets to HAL pins. +
It's possible to create widget responses by connecting signals  to python +
code in the handler file. + 

=== QTvcp Widgets

Qtvcp uses the PyQt5 toolkit's widgets for linuxcnc integration. +
Widget is the general name for objects such as buttons and labels in PyQT5. +
You are free to use any available widgets in the QTDesigner editor. +
There are also special widgets made for linuxcnc that make integration easier. +
This are split in three heading on the left side of the editor. +
One is for HAL only widgets. +
One is for cnc control widgets. +
One is for dialog widgets. +
you are free to mix them in any way on your panel. +
A very important widget for CNC control is the screenoptions widget. +
It does not add anything visually to the screen. +
But allows important details to be selected rather then be coded in the handler file. +

=== INI Settings

If you are using this to make a CNC control screen: +
Under the [DISPLAY] heading:

----
DISPLAY = qtvcp <options> <screen_name>
  options:
    -d debugging on
    -a set window always on top
    -c HAL component name. Default is to use the UI file name.
    -g geometry: WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFFSET+YOFFSET example: -g 200x400+0+100
    -m maximize window
    -f fullscreen the window
    -t theme. Default is system theme
    -x embed into a X11 window that doesn't support embedding.
    --push_xid send qtvcp's X11 window id number to standard output; for embedding
    -u file path of a substitute handler file
    -o pass a string to qtvcp's handler file under self.w.USEROPTIONS_ list variable. can be multiple -o

    all <options> must be before <screen name>
    <screen_name> is the base name of the .ui and _handler.py files.
    If <screen_name> is missing the default screen will be loaded.
----
Qtvcp assumes the UI file and the handler file use this same base name. +
Qtvcp will search the LinuxCNC configuration file that was launched first for the files,  +
then in the system skin folder. (The skin folders holds standard screens.) +

----
[DISPLAY]
CYCLE_TIME = 100
GRAPHICS_CYCLE_TIME = 100
HALPIN_CYCLE = 100
----

Adjust the response rate of the GUI updates in milli seconds. Defaults to 100, useable range 50 - 200 +
The widgets, graphics and HAL pin update can be set separately. +
If the update time is not set right the screen can become unresponsive or very jerky. +

=== QTDesigner UI File

A designer file is a text file organized in the XML standard that describes the +
layout and the widgets of the screen. Pyqt5 uses this file to build the display +
and react to those widgets. The QTDesigner editor makes it relatively easy to build +
and edit this file. +

=== Handler Files

A handler file is a file containing python code, which qtvcp adds to it's +
default routines. A handler file allows one to modify defaults, or add logic +
to a qtvcp skin without having to modify qtvcp's core code. +
In this way you can have custom behaviour. +
If present a handler file will be loaded. +
Only one file is allowed. +

=== Libraries modules
Qtvcp as built does little more then display the screen and react to widgets. +
For more prebuilt behaviours there are available libraries. +
(found in lib/python/qtvcp/lib in RIP linuxcnc install) +
libraries are prebuilt python modules that give added features to Qtvcp. +
In this way you can select what features you want - yet don't have to build common ones yourself. +
Such libraries include: +

audio_player +
aux_program_loader +
keybindings +
message +
preferences +
notify +
virtual_keyboard +
machine_log +


=== Themes

Themes are a way to modify the look and feel of the widgets on the screen. +
For instance the color or size of buttons and sliders can be changed using
themes. +
The Windows theme is default for screens. System theme is default for panels. +
to see available themes load qtvcp with -d -t SHOWTHEMES +

qtvcp can also be customized with Qt stylesheets using css. +

=== Local Files

If present, local UI files in the configuration folder will be loaded instead +
of the stock UI files. Local UI files allow you to use your customized +
designs rather then the default screens. +
QTVCP will look for a folder name MYNAME (in the launched configuration folder that holds the INI file). +
In that folder QTVCP will load any of the available files; MYNAME.ui, MYNAME_handler.py and MYNAME.qss. +

=== Modifying Stock Screens

If you wish to modify a stock screen, copy it's UI and handler file to your configuration folder. +
There is a QtVCP panel to help with this. +
Open a terminal and type 'qtvcp copy_dialog' and a dialog will show to select the screen and +
destination folder. This will copy all the file - delete the ones you don't wish to modify so +
that the original files will be used. +
It you wish to name your screen differently then the builtin screen's default name - +
change the basename in the edit box.

== VCP Panels
Qtvcp can be used to create control panels that interface with HAL. +

=== Builtin panels

There are several builtin HAL panels available. +
in a  terminal type 'qtvcp' <return> to see a list. +

* test_panel - collect of useful widgets for testing HAL component. Including speech of LED state.
* cam_align - a camera display widget for rotational alignment
* sim_panel - a small control panel to simulate MPG jogging controls etc. for simulated configurations
* vismach_mill_xyz - 3d openGL view of a 3 axis milling machine

.qtvismach- 3 Axis Mill Builtin panel
image::images/qtvismach.png["QtVismach Mill",align="left"]

[source,hal]
----
loadusr qtvcp test_panel
----

You can of course make your own panel and load it. +
If you made a ui file named 'my_panel.ui' and name the following HAL file, 'my_panel.hal' +
You would then load this from a terminal with halrun -I -f my_panel.hal +

[source,hal]
----
# load realtime components
loadrt threads 
loadrt classicladder_rt

# load user space programs
loadusr classicladder
loadusr -Wn my_panel qtvcp my_panel.ui

# add components to thread
addf classicladder.0.refresh thread1


# connect pins
net bit-input1     test_panel.checkbox_1        classicladder.0.in-00
net bit-hide       test_panel.checkbox_4        classicladder.0.hide_gui

net bit-output1    test_panel.led_1             classicladder.0.out-00

net s32-in1        test_panel.doublescale_1-s   classicladder.0.s32in-00

# start thread
start
----

In this case we load qtvcp using -Wn; which waits for the panel to finish loading before +
continuing to run the next HAL command. This is so the HAL pins from the panel are finished +
in case the are used in the rest of the file.

== Build a simple clean-sheet custom screen

.Ugly custom screen
image::images/qtvcp_tester.png["QTscreen Mill",align="left"]

=== Overview

To build a panel or screen use QTDesigner to build a design you like. +
Save this design to your configuration folder with a name of your choice, ending with .ui +
modify the configurations INI file to load qtvcp with your new .ui file. +
Then connect any required HAL pins in a HAL file +

=== Get Designer to include linuxcnc widgets

You must have designer installed; These commands should add it: +
Or use your package manager to install the same: +
'sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools' +
'sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev' +
'sudo apt-get install libpython3-dev' +

Then you must add a link to the qtvcp_plugin.py to the folder that designer will search. +

In a RIP version of linuxcnc qtvcp_plugin.py will be in: +
'~/LINUXCNC_PROJECT_NAME/lib/python/qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py' +

installed version should be: +
'usr/lib/python2.7/qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py' +
or
'usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py' +

make a link file to the above file and move it to one of the places Designer searches: +

Designer searches in these two place for links (pick one): +
This can be: +
'/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/python' +
or +
'~/.designer/plugins/python' +
You may need to add the plugins/python folders +

To start Designer: +

for a RIP installed: +
open a terminal, set the environment for linuxcnc with the command: '. scripts/rip-environment' +
then load designer with : 'designer -qt=5' +

otherwise for an installed version, open a terminal and type 'designer -qt=5' +

If all goes right you will see the selectable linuxcnc widgets on the left hand side +

=== build the screen .ui file

When Designer is first started there is a 'New Form' dialog displayed. +
Pick 'Main Window' and press the 'create' button. +
Do not rename this window - Qtvcp requires the name to be 'MainWindow' +
 +
A MainWindow widget is Displayed. Grab the corner of the window and resize to +
an appropriate size say 1000x600. right click on the window and click +
set minimum size. Do it again and set maximum size.Our sample widget will +
now not be resizable. +
 +
Drag and drop the screenoption widget onto the main window (anywhere). +
This widget doesn't add anything visually but sets up some common options. +
It's recommended to always add this widget before any other. +
Right click on the main window (not the screenoptions widget) +
and set the layout as vertical. The screenoption widget will now be fullsized. +

On the right hand side there is a panel with tabs for a Property editor and +
an object inspector. On the Object inspector click on the screenoption. then +
switch to the property Editor. Under the heading 'ScreenOptions' toggle +
'filedialog_option'. +

Drag and drop a GCodeGraphics widget and a GcodeEditor widget. +
Place and resize them as you see fit leaving some room for buttons. +

Now we will add action buttons. +
Add 7 action buttons on to the main window. If you double click the button, you +
can add text. Edit the button labels for 'Estop', 'Machine On', 'Home', 'Load', +
'Run', 'Pause' and 'stop'. +
Action buttons default to no action so we must change the properties for defined functions. +
You can edit the properties directly in the property editor on the right side of designer. +
A convenient alternating is left double clicking on the button This will launch a Dialog +
that allows selecting actions while only display relevant data to the action. +
 +
We will describe the convenient way first: +

 - Right click the 'Machine On' button and select 'Set Actions'. When the Dialog displays, +
use the combobox to navigate to 'MACHINE CONTROLS - Machine On'. In this case there there +
is no option for this action so select ok. Now the button will turn the machine on when pressed +

And now the direct way with Designer's property editor +

 - Select the 'Machine On' button. Now go to the 'Property Editor' on the right +
side of Designer. Scroll down until you find the 'ActionButton' heading. +
You will see a list of properties and values. find the 'machine on action' and +
click the checkbox. the button will now control machine on/off. +

Do the same for all the other button with the addition of: +

 - With the 'Home' button we must also change the joint_number property to -1, +
Which tells the controller to home all the axes rather then a specific axis. +

 - With the 'Pause' button under the heading 'Indicated_PushButton' check the +
'indicator_option' and under the 'QAbstactButton' heading check 'checkable'

.Qt Designer - Selecting Pause button's properties
image::images/designer_button_property.png["designer button property",align="left"]

We then need to save this design as 'tester.ui' in the sim/qtvcp folder +
We are saving it as tester as that is a file name that qtvcp recognizes and +
will use a built in handler file to display it. +

=== Handler file
a handler file is required. It allows customizations to be written in python. +
For instance keyboard controls are usually written in the handler file. +
 +
In this example the built in file 'tester_handler.py' is automatically used. +
It does the minimum required to display the tester.ui defined screen and do +
basic keyboard jogging. +

=== INI

If you are using qtvcp to make a CNC control screen: +
Under the '[DISPLAY]' heading: +
 +
'DISPLAY = qtvcp <screen_name>' +
 +
'<screen_name>' is the base name of the .ui and _handler.py files. +

In our example there is already a sim configuration called tester, that we +
will use to display our test screen.

=== HAL

If your screen used widgets with HAL pins, then you must connect them in a HAL file. +
Qtvcp looks in the INI file, under the heading '[HAL]' for the entry 'POSTGUI_HALFILE=<filename>' +
Typically '<filename>' would be the screens base name + '_postgui' + '.hal' +
eg. 'qtvcp_postgui.hal', but can be any legal filename. +
These commands are executed after the screen is built, guaranteeing the widget HAL +
pins are available. +
You can have multiple line of 'POSTGUI_HALFILE=<filename>' in the INI. +
Each will be run one after the other in the order they appear. +
 +
Qtvcp also looks in the INI file, under the heading '[HAL]' for the entry 'POSTGUI_HALCMD=<command>' +
'<command>' would be any valid HAL command. +
These commands are executed after the screen is built, after all the POSTGUI_HALFILEs are run, +
guaranteeing the widget HAL pins are available. +
You can have multiple line of 'POSTGUI_HALCMD=<command>' in the INI. +
Each will be run one after the other in the order they appear. +
 +
In our example there are no HAl pins to connect. +

== Handler file in detail
handler files are used to create custom controls using python. +

=== Overview
Here is a sample handler file. +
It's broken up in sections for ease of discussion. +

----

=== IMPORT SECTION
This section is for importing library modules required for your screen. +
It would be typical to import qtvcp's keybinding, Status and action +
libraries. +

=== INSTANTIATE LIBRARIES SECTION
By instantiating the libraries here we create global reference. +
You can note this by the commands that don't have 'self.' in front of them. +
By convention we capitalize the names of global referenced libraries. +

=== HANDLER CLASS section 
The custom code is placed in a class so qtvcp can utilize it. +
This is the definitions on the handler class. +

=== INITIALIZE section
Like all python libraries the __init__ function is called when the library +
is first instantiated. You can set defaults and reference variables here. +
The widget references are not available at this point. +
The variables halcomp, widgets and paths give access to qtvcp's HAL component, +
widgets, and path info respectably. +
This is where you would set up global variables. +
Widgets are not actually accessible at this point. +

=== SPECIAL FUNCTIONS section
There are several special functions that qtvcp looks for in the handler file. +
If qtvcp finds these it will call them, if not it will silently ignore them. +

==== initialized__(self):
This function is called after the widgets and HAL pins are built +
You can manipulate the widgets and HAL pins or add more HAL pins here. +
Typically preferences can be checked and set, styles applied to  +
widgets or status of linuxcnc be connected to functions. +
This is also where keybindings would be added. +

==== class_patch__(self):
Class patching allow you to override function calls in an imported module. +
Class patching must be done before the module is instantiated and it modifies +
all instances made after that. +
An example might be patching button calls from the gcode editor to call functions +
in the handler file instead. +
Class patching is also known as monkey patching.

==== processed_key_event__(self, receiver,event,is_pressed,key,code,shift,cntrl):
This function is called to facilitate keyboard jogging etc. +
By using the keybindings library this can be used to easily add +
functions bound to keypresses. +

==== keypress_event__(self,receiver, event)):
This function gives raw key press events. It takes presidence over +
the processed_key_event. +
 
==== keyrelease_event__(receiver, event):
This function gives raw key release events. It takes presidence over +
the processed_key_event. +

==== before_loop__(self):
This function is called just before the Qt event loop is entered. +
At the point all widgets/libraries/initialization code has completed and the screen is already displayed. +

==== system_shutdown_request__(self):
If present, this function overrides the normal function called when a user selects a total system shutdown. +
It could be used to do pre-shutdown housekeeping. The system will not shutdown if using this function, you will +
have to do that yourself. qtvcp/linuxcnc will shutdown without a prompt after this function returns +
 
==== closing_cleanup__(self):
This function is called just before the screen closes. It can be used +
to do cleanup before closing. +

=== STATUS CALLBACKS section
By convention this is where you would put functions that are callbacks +
from STATUS definitions. +

=== CALLBACKS FROM FORM section
By convention this is where you would put functions that are callbacks +
from the widgets that you have connected to the MainWindow with the +
designer editor. +

=== GENERAL FUNCTIONS section
By convention this is where you put your general functions +

=== KEY BINDING section
If you are using the keybinding library this is where you place your +
custom key call routines. +
The function signature is: +
[source,python]
----
    def on_keycall_KEY(self,event,state,shift,cntrl):
        if state:
            self.do_something_function()
----
'KEY' being the code (from the keybindings library) for the desired key. +

=== CLOSING EVENT section
Putting the close event function here will catch closing events. +
This replaces any predefined closeEvent function from qtvcp +
It's usually better to use the special closing_cleanup__ function. +
[source,python]
----
    def closeEvent(self, event):
        self.do_something()
        event.accept()
----

== Connecting widgets to python code
It's possible to connect widgets to python code using signals and slots. +
In this way you can give new functions to linuxcnc widgets or utilize +
standard widgets to control linuxcnc. +

=== Overview
In the Designer editor you would create user function slots and connect +
them to widgets using signals. +
In the handler file you would create the slot's functions defined in Designer. +

[[cha:designer-slots]]

=== Using Designer to add slots
When you have loaded your screen into designer add a plain PushButton to the screen. +
You could change the name of the button to something interesting like 'test_button' +
There are two ways to edit connections - This is the graphical way +
There is a button in the top tool bar of designer for editing signals. +
After pushing it, if you click-and-hold on the button it will show a arrow +
(looks like a ground signal from electrical schematic) +
Slide this arrow to a part of the main window that does not have widgets on it. +
A 'Configure Connections' dialog will pop up. +
The list on the left are the available signals from the widget. +
The list on the right is the available slots on the main window and you can add to it. +

Pick the signal 'clicked()' - this makes the slots side available. +
click 'edit' on the slots list. +
A 'Slots/Signals of MainWindow' dialog will pop up. +
On the slots list at the top there is a plus icon - click it. +
you can now edit a new slot name. +
Erase the default name 'slot()' and change it to test_button() +
press the ok button. +
You'll be back to the 'Configure Connections' dialog. +
now you can select your new slot in the slot list. +
then press ok and save the file. +

=== Handler file changes
Now you must add the function to the handler file. +
The function signature is 'def slotname(self):' +
We will add some code to print the widget name. +

So for our example:
[source,python]
----
def test_button(self):
    name = self.w.sender().text()
    print name
----

Add this code under the section named:

    #######################
    # callbacks from form #
    #######################

In fact it doesn't matter where in the handler class you put the commands
but by convention this is where to put it. +
Save the handler file. +
Now when you load your screen and press the button it should print the name +
of the button in the terminal. +
