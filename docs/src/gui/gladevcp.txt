== What is GladeVCP?

GladeVCP is an LinuxCNC component which adds the ability to add a new user
interface panel to LinuxCNC user interfaces like:

    -Axis
    -Touchy
    -Gscreen
    -Gmoccapy

Unlike PyVCP, GladeVCP is not limited to displaying and setting HAL pins,
as arbitrary actions can be executed in Python code - in fact, a
complete LinuxCNC user interface could be built with GladeVCP and Python.

GladeVCP uses the http://glade.gnome.org/[Glade] WYSIWYG user
interface editor, which makes it easy to create visually pleasing
panels. It relies on the http://www.pygtk.org/[PyGTK] bindings to the
rich http://www.gtk.org/[GTK+] widget set, and in fact all of these
may be used in a GladeVCP application - not just the specialized
widgets for interacting with HAL and LinuxCNC, which are documented here.


=== PyVCP versus GladeVCP at a glance

Both support the creation of panels with 'HAL widgets' - user
interface elements like LED's, buttons, sliders etc whose values are
linked to a HAL pin, which in turn interfaces to the rest of LinuxCNC.

*PyVCP:*

 - widget set: uses TkInter widgets
 - user interface creation: "edit XML file / run result / evaluate looks" cycle
 - no support for embedding user-defined event handling
 - no LinuxCNC interaction beyond HAL pin I/O supported

*GladeVCP:*

 - widget set: relies on the  http://www.gtk.org/[GTK+] widget set.
 - user interface creation: uses the  http://glade.gnome.org/[Glade] WYSIWYG user interface editor
 - any HAL pin change may be directed to call back into a user-defined Python event handler
 - any GTK signal (key/button press, window, I/O, timer, network events) may be associated with user-defined handlers in Python
 - direct LinuxCNC interaction: arbitrary command execution, like initiating MDI
commands to call a G-code subroutine, plus support for status change operations through Action Widgets 
 - several independent GladeVCP panels may be run in different tabs
 - separation of user interface appearance and functionality: change appearance without touching any code

== A Quick Tour with the Example Panel

GladeVCP panel windows may be run in three different setups:

 - always visible integrated into Axis at the right side, exactly like PyVCP panels
 - as a tab in Axis,Touchy, Gscreen, or Gmoccapy; in Axis this would create a third
tab besides the Preview and DRO tabs which must be raised explicitly
 - as a standalone toplevel window, which can be iconifyed/deiconified independent of the main window.

.Installed LinuxCNC
If you're using an installed version of LinuxCNC the examples shown below are in
the <<cha:starting-linuxcnc,configuration picker>> in the 'Sample
Configurations > apps > gladevcp' branch.

.Git Checkout
The following instructions only apply if you're using a git checkout. Open a
terminal and change to the directory created by git then issue the commands
as shown.

[NOTE]
For the following commands to work on your git checkout you must first run
'make' then run 'sudo make setuid' then run '. ./scripts/rip-environment'.
More information about a git checkout is on the linuxcnc wiki page.

Run the sample GladeVCP panel integrated into Axis like PyVCP as follows:

----
$ cd configs/sim/axis/gladevcp
$ linuxcnc gladevcp_panel.ini
----

image::images/example-panel-small.png[]

Run the same panel, but as a tab inside Axis:

----
$ cd configs/sim/axis/gladevcp
$ linuxcnc gladevcp_tab.ini
----

image::images/example-tabbed-small.png[]

////
To run this panel as a standalone toplevel window besides Axis, just
start Axis in the background and start gladevcp as follows:

FIXME: I'm not sure how this is supposed to work with axis in one
directory and gladevcp in a different directory.

FIXME: there is a conflict for motion.N.spindle-speed-out since it is used by both
   axis.ini: sim_spindle_encoder.hal
   and
   manual-example.ui: manual-example.hal

commit cd36e2 Jan 5 2012 added sim_spindle_encoder.hal to axis.ini
probably after creation of manual-example.ui
----
$ cd configs/sim/axis
$ linuxcnc axis.ini &
$ cd gladevcp
$ gladevcp -c gladevcp -u ./hitcounter.py -H ./manual-example.hal ./manual-example.ui
----

image::images/example-float-small.png[]
////

To run this panel inside 'Touchy':

----
$ cd configs/sim/touchy/gladevcp
$ linuxcnc gladevcp_touchy.ini
----

image::images/touchy-tab-33.png[]


Functionally these setups are identical - they only differ in screen
real estate requirements and visibility. Since it is possible to run
several GladeVCP components in parallel (with different HAL component
names), mixed setups are possible as well - for instance a panel on
the right hand side, and one or more tabs for less-frequently used
parts of the interface.

=== Exploring the example panel

While running configs/sim/axis/gladevcp_panel.ini or configs/sim/axis/gladevcp_tab.ini,
explore 'Show HAL Configuration' - you will find the 'gladevcp' HAL component and may
observe their pin values while interacting with the widgets in the panel. The HAL setup can be
found in 'configs/axis/gladevcp/manual-example.hal'.

The example panel has two frames at the bottom. The panel is
configured so that resetting ESTOP activates the Settings frame and
turning the machine on  enables the Commands frame at the bottom. The HAL
widgets in the Settings frame are linked to LEDs and labels in the
'Status' frame, and to the current and prepared tool number - play
with them to see the effect. Executing the 'T<toolnumber>' and 'M6'
commands in the MDI window will change the current and prepared tool
number fields.

The buttons in the 'Commands' frame are 'MDI Action widgets' -
pressing them will execute an MDI command in the interpreter.  The
third button 'Execute Oword subroutine' is an advanced example - it
takes several HAL pin values from the 'Settings' frame, and passes
them as parameters to the Oword subroutine. The actual parameters
received by the routine are displayed by '(DEBUG, )' commands - see
'../../nc_files/oword.ngc' for the subroutine body.

To see how the panel is integrated into Axis, see the
'[DISPLAY]GLADEVCP' statement in configs/sim/axis/gladevcp/gladevcp_panel.ini, the
'[DISPLAY]EMBED*' statement in configs/sim/axis/gladevcp/gladevcp_tab.ini 
and '[HAL]POSTGUI_HALFILE' statements in both configs/sim/axis/gladevcp/gladevcp_tab.ini
and configs/sim/axis/gladevcp/gladevcp_panel.ini

=== Exploring the User Interface description

The user interface is created with the glade UI editor - to explore
it, you need to have <<gladevcp:prerequisites, glade installed>>. To
edit the user interface, run the command

 $ glade configs/axis/gladevcp/manual-example.ui

(The required glade program may be named glade-gtk2 on more recent systems.)

The center window shows the appearance of the UI. All user
interface objects and support objects are found in the right top
window, where you can select a specific widget (or by clicking on it
in the center window). The properties of the selected widget are
displayed, and can be changed, in the right bottom window.

To see how MDI commands are passed from the MDI Action widgets,
explore the widgets listed under 'Actions' in the top right window,
and in the right bottom window, under the 'General' tab, the 'MDI
command' property.

=== Exploring the Python callback
See how a Python callback is integrated into the example:

 - in glade, see the +hits+ label widget (a plain GTK+ widget)
 - in the +button1+ widget, look at the 'Signals' tab, and find the signal 'pressed' associated with the handler 'on_button_press'
 - in hitcounter.py, see the method 'on_button_press' and see how it sets the label property in the 'hits' object

The is just touching upon the concept - the callback mechanism will be
handled in more detail in the
<<gladevcp:programming,GladeVCP Programming>> section.

== Creating and Integrating a Glade user interface

[[gladevcp:prerequisites]]

=== Prerequisite: Glade installation
To view or modify Glade UI files, you need glade 3.8.0 installed - it is not
needed just to run a GladeVCP panel. If the glade command is missing, install
it with the command:

 $ sudo apt-get install glade-gtk2

Verify the version number to be 3.8.0 or less

 $ glade-gtk2 --version
glade3 3.8.0

=== Running Glade to create a new user interface
This section just outlines the initial LinuxCNC-specific steps. For more
information and a tutorial on glade, see http://glade.gnome.org. Some
glade tips & tricks may also be found on
http://www.youtube.com[youtube].

Either modify an existing UI component by running +glade <file>.ui+
or start a new one by just running the +glade+ command from the shell.

- If LinuxCNC was not installed from a package, the LinuxCNC shell environment needs to be set up with
+. <linuxcncdir>/scripts/rip-environment+, otherwise glade won't find the LinuxCNC-specific widgets.
- When asked for unsaved Preferences, just accept the defaults and hit 'Close'.
- From 'Toplevel' (left pane), pick 'Window' (first icon) as top level window, which
by default will be named 'window1'. Do not change this name - GladeVCP relies on it.
- In the left tab, scroll down and expand  'HAL Python' and 'VCP Actions'.
- add a container like a HAL_Box or a HAL_Table from 'HAL Python' to the frame
- pick and place some elements like LED, button, etc. within a container

This will look like so:

image::images/glade-manual-small.png[]

Glade tends to write a lot of messages to the shell window, which
mostly can be ignored.  Select 'File→Save as', give it a name like
'myui.ui' and make sure it's saved as 'GtkBuilder' file (radio button
left bottom corner in Save dialog). GladeVCP will also process the
older 'libglade' format correctly but there is no point in using it. The
convention for GtkBuilder file extension is '.ui'.

=== Testing a panel
You're now ready to give it a try (while LinuxCNC, e.g. Axis is running) it with:

    gladevcp myui.ui

GladeVCP creates a HAL component named like the basename of the UI
file - 'myui' in this case - unless overridden by the +-c <component
name>+ option.  If running Axis, just try 'Show HAL configuration' and
inspect its pins.

You might wonder why widgets contained a 'HAL_Hbox' or 'HAL_Table' appear
greyed out (inactive). HAL containers have an associated HAL pin which
is off by default, which causes all contained widgets to render
inactive. A common use case would be to associate these container HAL
pins with +halui.machine.is-on+ or one of the +halui.mode.+ signals,
to assure some widgets appear active only in a certain state.

To just activate a container, execute the HAL command +setp gladevcp.<container-name> 1+.

=== Preparing the HAL command file
The suggested way of linking HAL pins in a GladeVCP panel is to
collect them in a separate file with extension +.hal+. This file is
passed via the +POSTGUI_HALFILE=+ option in the +HAL+ section of your
ini file.

CAUTION: Do not add the GladeVCP HAL command file to the Axis +[HAL]HALFILE=+ ini
section, this will not have the desired effect - see the following sections.

=== Integrating into Axis like PyVCP

Place the GladeVCP panel in the righthand side panel by specifying the
following in the ini file:

[source,{ini}]
----
[DISPLAY]
# add GladeVCP panel where PyVCP used to live:
GLADEVCP= -u ./hitcounter.py ./manual-example.ui

[HAL]
# HAL commands for GladeVCP components in a tab must be executed via POSTGUI_HALFILE
POSTGUI_HALFILE =  ./manual-example.hal

[RS274NGC]
# gladevcp Demo specific Oword subs live here
SUBROUTINE_PATH = ../../nc_files/gladevcp_lib
----
The HAL component name of a GladeVCP application started with the GLADEVCP option is fixed:  +gladevcp+.
The command line actually run by Axis in the above configuration is as follows:

 halcmd loadusr -Wn gladevcp gladevcp -c gladevcp -x {XID} <arguments to GLADEVCP>

This means you may add arbitrary gladevcp options here, as long as
they dont collide with the above command line options.

[NOTE]
The file specifiers like ./hitcounter.py, ./manual-example.ui, etc. indicate that the files
are located in the same directory as the ini file.  You might have to copy them to you
directory (alternatively, specify a correct absolute or relative path to the file(s))

[NOTE]
The +[RS274NGC]SUBROUTINE_PATH=+ option is only set so the example
panel will find the Oword subroutine (oword.ngc) for the MDI Command widget. It
might not be needed in your setup.  The relative path specifier ../../nc_files/gladevcp_lib
is constructed to work with directories copied by the configuration picker and when
using a run-in-place setup.

[[gladevcp:embeding-tab]]

=== Embeding as a Tab

To do so, edit your .ini file and add to the DISPLAY and HAL sections of ini
file as follows:

[source,{ini}]
----
[DISPLAY]
# add GladeVCP panel as a tab next to Preview/DRO:
EMBED_TAB_NAME=GladeVCP demo
EMBED_TAB_COMMAND=halcmd loadusr -Wn gladevcp gladevcp -c gladevcp -x {XID} -u ./gladevcp/hitcounter.py ./gladevcp/manual-example.ui

[HAL]
# HAL commands for GladeVCP components in a tab must be executed via POSTGUI_HALFILE
POSTGUI_HALFILE =  ./gladevcp/manual-example.hal

[RS274NGC]
# gladevcp Demo specific Oword subs live here
SUBROUTINE_PATH = ../../nc_files/gladevcp_lib
----

Note the 'halcmd loadusr' way of starting the tab command - this
assures that 'POSTGUI_HALFILE' will only be run after the HAL
component is ready. In rare cases you might run a a command here which
uses a tab but does not have an associated HAL component. Such a
command can be started without 'halcmd loadusr', and this signifies to
Axis that it does not have to wait for a HAL component since there is
none.

When changing the component name in the above example, note that the
names used in +-Wn <component>+ and +-c <component>+ must be
identical.

Try it out by running Axis - there should be a new tab called
'GladeVCP demo' near the DRO tab. Select that tab, you should see the
example panel nicely fit within Axis.

[NOTE]
Make sure the UI file is the last option passed to GladeVCP in
both the +GLADEVCP=+ and +EMBED_TAB_COMMAND=+ statements.

=== Integrating into Touchy
To do add a GladeVCP tab to 'Touchy', edit your .ini file as follows:

[source,{ini}]
----
[DISPLAY]
# add GladeVCP panel as a tab
EMBED_TAB_NAME=GladeVCP demo
EMBED_TAB_COMMAND=gladevcp -c gladevcp -x {XID} -u ./hitcounter.py -H ./gladevcp-touchy.hal  ./manual-example.ui

[RS274NGC]
# gladevcp Demo specific Oword subs live here
SUBROUTINE_PATH = ../../nc_files/gladevcp_lib
----

[NOTE]
The file specifiers like ./hitcounter.py, ./manual-example.ui, etc. indicate that the files
are located in the same directory as the ini file.  You might have to copy them to you
directory (alternatively, specify a correct absolute or relative path to the file(s))


Note the following differences to the Axis tab setup:

 - The HAL command file is slightly modified since 'Touchy' does not
 use the 'halui' components so its signals are not available and some
 shortcuts have been taken.

 - there is no 'POSTGUI_HALFILE=' ini option, but passing the HAL command file on the 'EMBED_TAB_COMMAND=' line is ok

 - the 'halcmd loaduser -Wn ...' incantation is not needed.

== GladeVCP command line options

See also 'man gladevcp' . These are the gladevcp command line options:

Usage: gladevcp [options] myfile.ui

Options:

-h, --help::
    show this help message and exit

-c NAME::
    Set component name to NAME. Default is base name of UI file

-d::
    Enable debug output

-g GEOMETRY::
     Set geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFFSET+YOFFSET. Values are in pixel units,
    XOFFSET/YOFFSET is referenced from top left of screen.
    Use -g WIDTHxHEIGHT for just setting size or -g +XOFFSET+YOFFSET for just
    position 

-H FILE::
    execute hal statements from FILE with halcmd after the
    component is set up and ready

-m MAXIMUM::
    force panel window to maximize.  Together with the -g geometry option 
    one can move the panel to a second monitor and force it to use all of the screen

-t THEME::
    set gtk theme. Default is system theme. Different panels can have different themes.
    An example theme can be found in the http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?GTK_Themes[EMC Wiki].

-x XID::
     Re-parent GladeVCP into an existing window XID instead of creating a
    new top level window

-u FILE::
    Use File's as additional user defined modules with handlers

-U USEROPT::
    pass USEROPTs to Python modules

== Understanding the gladeVCP startup process

The integration steps outlined above look a bit tricky, and they
are. It does therefore help to understand the startup process of
LinuxCNC and how this relates to gladeVCP.

The normal LinuxCNC startup process does the following:

- the realtime environment is started
- all HAL components are loaded
- the HAL components are linked together through the .hal cmd scripts
- task, iocontrol and eventually the user interface is started
- pre-gladeVCP the assumption was: by the time the UI starts, all of HAL is loaded, plumbed and ready to go

The introduction of gladeVCP brought the following issue:

- gladeVCP panels need to be embedded in a master GUI window setup, e.g. Axis, or Touchy, Gscreen, or Gmoccapy (embedded window or as an embedded tab)
- this requires the master GUI to run before the gladeVCP window can be hooked into the master GUI
- however gladeVCP is also a HAL component, and creates HAL pins of its own.
- as a consequence, all HAL plumbing involving gladeVCP HAL pins as source or destination must be run *after* the GUI has been set up

This is the purpose of the `POSTGUI_HALFILE`. This ini option is
inspected by the GUIs. If a GUI detects this option, it runs the
corresponding HAl file after any embedded gladVCP panel is set
up. However, it does not check whether a gladeVCP panel is actually
used, in which case the HAL cmd file is just run normally. So if you
do NOT start gladeVCP through `GLADEVCP` or `EMBED_TAB` etc, but later
in a separate shell window or some other mechanism, a HAL
command file in `POSTGUI_HALFILE` will be executed too early. Assuming
gladeVCP pins are referenced herein, this will fail with an error
message indicating that the gladeVCP HAL component is not available.

So, in case you run gladeVCP from a separate shell window (i.e. not
started by the GUI in an embedded fashion):

- you cannot rely on the `POSTGUI_HALFILE` ini option causing the HAL
commands being run 'at the right point in time', so comment that out
in the ini file
- explicitly pass the HAL command file which refers to gladeVCP pins
to gladeVCP with the '-H <halcmd file>' option (see previous section).


== HAL Widget reference

GladeVcp includes a collection of Gtk widgets with attached HAL pins
called HAL Widgets, intended to control, display or otherwise interact
with the LinuxCNC HAL layer. They are intended to be used with the Glade
user interface editor. With proper installation, the HAL Widgets should
show up in Glade's 'HAL Python' widget group. Many HAL specific fields
in the Glade 'General' section have an associated mouse-over tool tip.

HAL signals come in two variants, bits and numbers. Bits are off/on
signals. Numbers can be "float", "s32" or "u32". For more information
on HAL data types see the <<sec:hal-data,HAL manual>>. The GladeVcp
widgets can either display the value of the signal with an indicator
widget, or modify the signal value with a control widget. Thus there
are four classes of GladeVcp widgets that you can connect to a HAL
signal. Another class of helper widgets allow you to organize and
label your panel.

 - Widgets for indicating "bit" signals: <<gladevcp:hal-led,HAL_LED>>
 - Widgets for controlling "bit" signals: <<gladevcp:hal-buttons,HAL_Button HAL_RadioButton HAL_CheckButton>>
 - Widgets for indicating "number" signals: <<gladevcp:hal-label,HAL_Label>>,
   <<gladevcp:hal-progressbar,HAL_ProgressBar>>,
   <<gladevcp:hal-bars,HAL_HBar and HAL_VBar>>, <<gladevcp:hal-meter,HAL_Meter>>
 - Widgets for controlling "number" signals: <<gladevcp:hal-spinbutton,HAL_SpinButton>>,
   <<gladevcp:hal-scales,HAL_HScale and HAL_VScale>>, <<gladevcp:jogwheel, Jog Wheel>>, <<gladevcp:speedcontrol, Speed Control>>
 - Sensitive control widgets: <<gladevcp:hal-table, State_Sensitive_Table HAL_Table and HAL_HBox>>
 - Tool Path preview: <<gladevcp:hal-gremlin,HAL_Gremlin>>
 - Widgets to show axis positions: <<gladevcp:dro_widget, DRO Widget>>,
   <<gladevcp:combi_dro, Combi DRO Widget>>
 - Widgets for file handling: <<gladevcp:iconview, IconView File Selection>>
 - Widgets for display/edit of all axes offsets: <<gladevcp:offsetpage, OffsetPage >>
 - Widgets for display/edit of all tool offsets: <<gladevcp:tooledit, Tooloffset editor >>
 - Widget for Gcode display and edit: <<gladevcp:hal-sourceview, HAL_Sourceview >>
 - widget for MDI input and history display: <<gladevcp:mdi-history, MDI History >>

=== Widget and HAL pin naming

Most HAL widgets have a single associated HAL pin with the same HAL name
as the widget (glade: General→Name).

Exceptions to this rule currently are.

- 'HAL_Spinbutton' and 'HAL_ComboBox', which have two pins: a +<widgetname>-f+ (float) and a +<widgetname>-s+ (s32) pin
- 'HAL_ProgressBar', which has a +<widgetname>-value+ input pin, and a +<widgetname>-scale+ input pin.

===  Python attributes and methods of HAL Widgets

HAL widgets are instances of GtKWidgets and hence inherit the methods,
properties and signals of the applicable GtkWidget class. For
instance, to figure out which GtkWidget-related methods, properties
and signals a 'HAL_Button' has, lookup the description of
http://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtkbutton.html[GtkButton] in the
http://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk[PyGtk Reference Manual]. 

An easy way to find out the inheritance relationship of a given HAL
widget is as follows: run glade, place the widget in a window, and
select it; then choose the 'Signals' tab in the 'Properties'
window. For example, selecting a 'HAL_LED' widget, this will show that
a 'HAL_LED' is derived from a  'GtkWidget', which in turn is derived
from a 'GtkObject', and eventually a 'GObject'.

HAL Widgets also have a few HAL-specific Python attributes:

hal_pin::
   the underlying HAL pin Python object in case the widget has a
   single pin type

hal_pin_s, hal_pin_f::
   the S32 and float pins of the 'HAL_Spinbutton' and
   'HAL_ComboBox' widgets - note these widgets do not have a
   'hal_pin' attribute!

hal_pin_scale::
  the float input pin of 'HAL_ProgressBar' widget representing
  the maximum absolute value of input. 
 
The are several HAL-specific methods of HAL Widgets, but the only
relevant method is:

<halpin>.get():: 
  Retrieve the value of the current HAL pin, where '<halpin>' is
  the applicable HAL pin name listed above.


=== Setting pin and widget values

As a general rule, if you need to set a HAL output widget's value from
Python code, do so by calling the underlying Gtk 'setter' (e.g.
+set_active()+, +set_value()+) - do not try to set the associated pin's
value by +halcomp[pinname] = value+ directly because the widget will not
take notice of the change!.

It might be tempting to 'set HAL widget input pins' programmatically.
Note this defeats the purpose of an input pin in the first place - it
should be linked to, and react to signals generated by other HAL
components. While there is currently no write protection on writing to
input pins in HAL Python, this doesn't make sense. You might use setp
pinname value in the associated halfile for testing though.

It is perfectly OK to set an output HAL pin's value with
+halcomp[pinname] = value+ provided this HAL pin is not associated with a
widget, that is, has been created by the
+hal_glib.GPin(halcomp.newpin(<name>,<type>,<direction>)+ method (see
<<gladevcp:programming,GladeVCP Programming>> for an example).

[[gladevcp:hal-pin-changed-signal]]

=== The hal-pin-changed signal

Event-driven programming means that the UI tells your code when "something
happens" - through a callback, like when a button was pressed. The
output HAL widgets (those which display a HAL pin's value) like LED,
Bar, VBar, Meter etc, support the 'hal-pin-changed' signal which may
cause a callback into your Python code when - well, a HAL pin changes
its value. This means there's no more need for permanent polling of HAL
pin changes in your code, the widgets do that in the background and let
you know.

Here is an example how to set a +hal-pin-changed+ signal for a HAL_LED
in the Glade UI editor:

image::images/hal-pin-change-66.png[]
The example in +configs/apps/gladevcp/complex+ shows how
this is handled in Python.

[[gladevcp:hal-buttons]]

=== Buttons

This group of widgets are derived from various Gtk buttons and consists
of HAL_Button, HAL_ToggleButton, HAL_RadioButton and CheckButton
widgets. All of them have a single output BIT pin named identical to
the widget. Buttons have no additional properties compared to their
base Gtk classes.

 - HAL_Button: instantaneous action, does not retain state. Important
   signal: +pressed+
 - HAL_ToggleButton, HAL_CheckButton: retains on/off state. Important
   signal: +toggled+
 - HAL_RadioButton: a one-of-many group. Important signal: +toggled+ (per
   button).
 - Important common methods: +set_active()+, +get_active()+
 - Important properties: +label+, +image+


// .Buttons
Check button:
image:images/checkbutton.png[]
Radio buttons:
image:images/radiobutton.png[]
Toggle button:
image:images/button.png[]
.

[TIP]
Defining radio button groups in Glade:
+
- decide on default active button
+
- in the other button's 'General→Group' select the default active
button's name in the 'Choose a Radio Button in this project' dialog.
+
See +configs/apps/gladevcp/by-widget/+ for a GladeVCP applications
and UI file for working with radio buttons.

[[gladevcp:hal-scales]]

=== Scales

HAL_HScale and HAL_VScale are derived from the GtkHScale and GtkVScale
respectively. They have one output FLOAT pin with name equal to widget
name. Scales have no additional properties.

To make a scale useful in Glade, add an 'Adjustment'
(General→Adjustment→New or existing adjustment) and edit the
adjustment object. It defines the default/min/max/increment 
values. Also, set adjustment 'Page size' and 'Page increment' to zero
to avoid warnings.

Example HAL_HScale:
image:images/hscale.png[]
.

[[gladevcp:hal-spinbutton]]

=== SpinButton

HAL SpinButton is derived from GtkSpinButton and holds two pins:

<widgetname>-f::
   out FLOAT pin
<widgetname>-s::
   out S32 pin

To be useful, Spinbuttons need an adjustment value like scales,
see above.

Example SpinButton:
image:images/spinbutton.png[]

=== Hal_Dial

The hal_dial widget simulates a jogwheel or adjustment dial. +
It can be operated with the mouse. You can just use the mouse wheel, while the mouse cursor is over the Hal_Dial widget, +
or you hold the left mouse button and move the cursor in circular direction to increase or degrease the counts. +
By double clicking the left or right button the scale factor can be increased or decreased. +

 * Counterclockwise   = reduce counts
 * Clockwise          = increase counts
 * Wheel up           = increase counts
 * Wheel down         = reduce counts
 * left Double Click  = x10 scale
 * Right Double Click = /10 scale

----
Hal_Dial exports it's count value as hal pins:

<widgetname>::
   out S32 pin
<widgetname>-scaled::
   out FLOAT pin
<widgetname>-delta-scaled::
   out FLOAT pin
----
It has the following properties:

cpr::
    Sets the Counts per Revolution, allowed values are in the range from 25 to 360 +
    default = 100
show_counts::
    Set this to False, if you want to hide the counts display in the middle of the widget. +
    default = True
label::
    Set the content of the label witch may be shown over the counts value. +
    If the label given is longer than 15 Characters, it will be cut to 15 Characters. +
    default = blank
center_color::
    This allows one to change the color of the wheel. It uses a GDK color string. +
    default = #bdefbdefbdef (gray)
count_type_shown::
    There are three counts available 0) Raw CPR counts 1) Scaled counts 2) Delta scaled counts. +
    default = 1
 * count is based on the CPR selected - it will count positive and negative. It is available as a S32 pin. +
 * Scaled-count is CPR count times the scale - it can be positive and negative. +
    If you change the scale the output will immediately reflect the change. It is available as a FLOAT pin. +
 * Delta-scaled-count is cpr count CHANGE, times scale. +
    If you change the scale, only the counts after that change will be scaled and then added to the current value. +
    It is available as a FLOAT pin.
scale_adjustable::
    Set this to False if you want to disallow scale changes by double clicking the widget. +
    If this is false the scale factor will not show on the widget. +
    default = True
scale::
    Set this to scale the counts. +
    default = 1.0


Direct program control::

    There are ways to directly control the widget using Python.

    Using goobject to set the above listed properties:
        [widget name].set_property("cpr",int(value))
        [widget name].set_property("show_counts, True)
        [widget name].set_property("center_color",gtk.gdk.Color('#bdefbdefbdef'))
        [widget name].set_property('label', 'Test Dial 12345')
        [widget name].set_property('scale_adjustable', True)
        [widget name].set_property('scale', 10.5)
        [widget name].set_property('count_type_shown', 0)

    There are python methods:
        [widget name].get_value()
            Will return the counts value as a s32 integer
        [widget name].get_scaled_value()
            Will return the counts value as a float
        [widget name].get_delta_scaled_value()
            Will return the counts value as a float
        [widget name].set_label("string")
            Sets the label content with "string"

    There are two GObject signals emitted:
        count_changed
            emitted when the widget's count changes eg. from being wheel scrolled.
        scale_changed
            emitted when the widget's scale changes eg. from double clicking. +
        connect to these like so:
            [widget name].connect('count_changed', [count function name])
            [widget name].connect('scale_changed', [scale function name]) +
        The callback functions would use this pattern:
            def [count function name](widget, count,scale,delta_scale):
        This will return: the widget, the current count, scale and delta scale of that widget.

[[gladevcp:jogwheel]]

=== Jog Wheel

The jogwheel widget simulates a real jogwheel. +
It can be operated with the mouse. You can just use the mouse wheel, while the mouse cursor is over the JogWheel widget, +
or you push the left mouse button and move the cursor in circular direction to increase or degrease the counts. +

 * Counterclockwise = reduce counts
 * Clockwise        = increase counts
 * Wheel up         = increase counts
 * Wheel down       = reduce counts

As moving the mouse the drag and drop way may be faster than the widget can update itself, you may loose counts turning to fast.
It is recommended to use the mouse wheel, and only for very rough movements the drag and drop way.

JogWheel exports it's count value as hal pin:

<widgetname>-s::
   out S32 pin


It has the following properties:

size::
    Sets the size in pixel of the widget, allowed values are in the range of 100 to 500
    default = 200
cpr::
    Sets the Counts per Revolution, allowed values are in the range from 25 to 100
    default = 40
show_counts::
    Set this to False, if you want to hide the counts display in the middle of the widget.
label::
    Set the content of the label witch may be shown over the counts value. The purpose is to give the user an idea about the usage of that jogwheel. If the label given is longer than 12 Characters, it will be cut to 12 Characters.


Direct program control::

    There a couple ways to directly control the widget using Python.

    Using gobject to set the above listed properties:
        [widget name].set_property("size",int(value))
        [widget name].set_property("cpr",int(value))
        [widget name].set_property("show_counts, True)

    There are two python methods:
        [widget name].get_value()
        Will return the counts value as integer
        [widget name].set_label("string")
        Sets the label content with "string"

[[gladevcp:speedcontrol]]

=== Speed Control

SpeedControl is a widget specially made to control an adjustment 
with a touch screen. It is a replacement to the normal scale widget
witch is difficult to slide on a touch screen.

The value is controlled with two button to increase or decrease the value. 
The Increment will change as long a button is pressed. The value of each increment 
as well as the time between two changes can be set using the widget properties. 

SpeedControl offers some hal pin:

<widgetname>-value::
   out float pin
   The shown value of the widget

<widgetname>-scaled-value::
   out float pin
   The shown value divided by the scale value, this is very useful, if the 
   velocity is shown in units / min, but linuxcnc expects it to be in units / second

<widgetname>-scale::
   in float pin
   The scale to apply
   Default is 60

<widgetname>-increase::
   in bit pin
   As long as the pin is true, the value will increase
   Very handy with connected momentary switch

<widgetname>-decrease::
   in bit pin
   As long as the pin is true, the value will decrease
   Very handy with connected momentary switch

It has the following properties:

height::
	integer
	The height of the widget in pixel
	allowed values are 24 to 96
	default is 36

value::
	float
	The  start value to set
	allowed values are in the range from 0.001 to 99999.0
	default is 10.0

min::
	float
	The min allowed value
	allowed values are 0.0 to 99999.0
	default is 0.0
        If you change this value, the increment will be reseted to default, so it might be necessary to set afterwards a new increment.

max::
	float
	The max allowed value
	allowed values are 0.001 to 99999.0
	default is 100.0
        If you change this value, the increment will be reseted to default, so it might be necessary to set afterwards a new increment.

increment::
        float
        sets the applied increment per mouse click
	allowed values are 0.001 to 99999.0 and -1
        default is -1 resulting in 100 increments from min to max

inc_speed::
	integer
	Sets the timer delay for the increment speed holding pressed the buttons
	allowed values are 20 to 300
	default is 100

unit::
	string
	Sets the unit to be shown in the bar after the value
	any string is allowed
	default is ""

color::
	Color
	Sets the color of the bar
	any hex color is allowed
	default is "#FF8116"

template::
	String
	Text template to display the value Python formatting is used
	Any allowed format
	default is "%.1f"

do_hide_button::
	Boolean
	Whether to show or hide the increment an decrement button
	True or False
	Default = False

Direct program control::

    There a couple ways to directly control the widget using Python.

    Using gobject to set the above listed properties:
        [widget name].set_property("do_hide_button",bool(value))
        [widget name].set_property("color","#FF00FF")
        [widget name].set_property("unit", "mm/min")
		etc.

    There are also python methods to modify the widget:
        [widget name].set_adjustment(gtk-adjustment)
        You can assign a existing adjustment to the control, that way it is easy to replace
        existing sliders without many code changes. Be aware, that after changing the adjustment
        you may need to set a new increment, as it will be reseted to its default (100 steps from MIN to MAX)
        [widget name].get_value()
        Will return the counts value as float
        [widget name].set_value(float(value))
        Sets the widget to the commanded value
        [widget name].set_digits(int(value))
        Sets the digits of the value to be used
        [widget name].hide_button(bool(value))
        Hide or show the button

Example Speedcontrol:

[[gladevcp:hal-label]]

=== Label

HAL_Label is a simple widget based on GtkLabel which represents a HAL
pin value in a user-defined format.

label_pin_type::
  The pin's HAL type  (0:S32, 1:float, 2:U32), see also the tooltip
  on 'General→HAL pin type '(note this is different from PyVCP which has
  three label widgets, one for each type).

text_template::
  Determines the text displayed - a Python
  format string to convert the pin value to text. Defaults to +%s+ (values
  are converted by the str() function) but may contain any legit as an
  argument to Pythons format() method. +
  Example: +Distance: %.03f+ will display the text and the pin value with
  3 fractional digits padded with zeros for a FLOAT pin.

[[gladevcp:hal-table]]

=== Containers

* HAL_HideTable
* HAL_Table State_Sensitive_Table
* HAL_HBox

These containers are meant to be used to sensitize (grey out) or hide their children. +
Insensitived children will not respond to input. +
HAL_HideTable has one HAL BIT input pin which controls if it's child widgets are hidden or not. +

<Panel_basename>.<widgetname>::

If the pin is low then child widgets are visible which is the default state.

HAL_Table and HAL_Hbox have one HAL BIT input pin which controls if their child widgets are sensitive or not. +
These widgets's pin name uses the convention: +

<Panel_basename>.<widgetname>::

If the pin is low then child widgets are inactive which is the default state.

State_Sensitive_table responds to the state to linuxcnc's interpreter. +
optionally selectable to respond to 'must-be-all-homed','must-be-on' and 'must-be-idle' +
You can combine them. It will always be insensitive at Estop. +
 +
* HAL_Hbox is depreceiated - use HAL_Table. +
If current panels use it it won't fail. You just won't find it in the GLADE editor anymore. +
Future vesions of gladeVCP may remove this widget completely and then you will need to update the panel. +

[TIP]
If you find some part of your GladeVCP application is 'grayed
out' (insensitive), see whether a HAL_Table pin is unset or unconnected.

[[gladevcp:hal-led]]

=== LED

The hal_led simulates a real indicator LED. +
It has a single input BIT pin which controls it's state: ON or OFF. +
LEDs have several properties which control their look and feel: +

on_color::
   a String defining ON color of LED. May be any valid
   gtk.gdk.Color name. Not working on Ubuntu 8.04.
off_color::
   String defining OFF color of LED. May be any valid
   gtk.gdk.Color name or special value `dark`. `dark` means that OFF color
   will be set to 0.4 value of ON color. Not working on Ubuntu 8.04.
pick_color_on, pick_color_off::
   Colors for ON and OFF states may be
   represented as `#RRRRGGGGBBBB` strings. These are optional properties
   which have precedence over `on_color` and `off_color`.
led_size::
   LED radius (for square - half of LED's side)
led_shape::
   LED Shape. Valid values are 0 for round, 1 for oval and 2
   for square shapes.
led_blink_rate::
   if set and LED is ON then it's blinking. Blink
   period is equal to "led_blink_rate" specified in milliseconds.
create hal pin::
    select/deselect making of HAL pin to control LED. With no HAL pin created
    LED can be controlled with a python function. 
As an input widget, LED also supports the +hal-pin-changed signal+. If
you want to get a notification in your code when the LED's HAL pin was
changed, then connect this signal to a handler, for example
+on_led_pin_changed+ and provide the handler as follows:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
def on_led_pin_changed(self,hal_led,data=None):
    print "on_led_pin_changed() - HAL pin value:",hal_led.hal_pin.get()
----------------------------------

This will be called at any edge of the signal and also during program
start up to report the current value.

Example LEDs:
image:images/leds.png[]

[[gladevcp:hal-progressbar]]

=== ProgressBar

[NOTE]
This widget might go away. Use the HAL_HBar and HAL_VBar widgets
instead.

The HAL_ProgressBar is derived from gtk.ProgressBar and has two float
HAL input pins:

<widgetname>::
  the current value to be displayed
<widgetname>-scale::
  the maximum absolute value of input

It has the following properties:

scale::
  value scale. set maximum absolute value of input. Same as
  setting the <widgetname>.scale pin. A float, range from
  -2^24 to +2^24.
green_limit::
      green zone limit lower limit
yellow_limit::
      yellow zone limit lower limit
red_limit::
      red zone limit lower limit
text_template::
      Text template to display the current value of the
      +<widgetname>+ pin. Python formatting may be used for dict
      +{"value":value}+

Example HAL_ProgressBar:
image:images/progressbar2.png[]

=== ComboBox

HAL_ComboBox is derived from gtk.ComboBox. It enables choice of a
value from a dropdown list.

It exports two HAL pins:

 <widgetname>-f::
      the current value, type FLOAT
 <widgetname>-s::
      the current value, type S32

It has the following property which can be set in Glade:

column::
   the column index, type S32, defaults to -1, range from -1..100 .

In default mode this widgets sets the pins to the index of the chosen
list entry. So if your widget has three labels, it may only assume
values 0,1 and 2.

In column mode (column > -1), the value reported is chosen from the
ListStore array as defined in Glade. So typically your widget
definition would have two columns in the ListStore , one with text
displayed in the dropdown, and an int or float value to use for that
choice.

There's an example in
+configs/apps/by-widget/combobox.{py,ui}+ which uses column
mode to pick a float value from the ListStore.

If you're confused like me about how to edit ComboBox ListStores and
CellRenderer, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5_F-rW2cL8.

[[gladevcp:hal-bars]]

=== Bars

HAL Bar and VBar widgets for horizontal and vertical bars representing
float values. They have one input FLOAT hal pin. Both bars have the
following properties:

invert::
   Swap min and max direction. An inverted HBar grows from right
   to left, an inverted VBar from top to bottom.
min, max::
   Minimum and maximum value of desired range. It is not an
   error condition if the current value is outside this range.
show limits::
    Used to select/deselect the limits text on bar.
zero::
   Zero point of range. If it's inside of min/max range then the
   bar will grow from that value and not from the left (or right) side of
   the widget. Useful to represent values that may be both positive or
   negative.
force_width, force_height::
   Forced width or height of widget. If not
   set then size will be deduced from packing or from fixed widget size
   and bar will fill whole area.
text_template::
   Like in Label sets text format for min/max/current
   values. Can be used to turn off value display.
value::
    Sets the bar display to the value entered: used only for testing in
    GLADE editor. The vaue will be set from A HAL pin.
target value::
    Sets the target line to the value entered: used only for testing in
    GLADE editor. The value will can be set in a Python function
target_width::
    Width of the line that marks the target value.
bg_color::
   Background (inactive) color of bar.
target_color::
    Color of the the target line.
z0_color, z1_color, z2_color::
   Colors of different value zones.
   Defaults are `green`, `yellow` and `red`. For description of zones see
   `z*_border` properties.
z0_border, z1_border::
   Define up bounds of color zones. By default
   only one zone is enabled. If you want more then one zone set
   `z0_border` and `z1_border` to desired values so zone 0 will fill from
   0 to first border, zone 1 will fill from first to second border and
   zone 2 -- from last border to 1. Borders are set as fractions, values
   from 0 to 1.

.

[[gladevcp:hal-meter]]

=== Meter

HAL Meter is a widget similar to PyVCP meter - it represents a float value and has 
one input FLOAT hal pin. HAL Meter has the following properties:

min, max::
   Minimum and maximum value of desired range. It is not an
   error condition if the current value is outside this range.
force_size::
   Forced diameter of widget. If not set then size will be
   deduced from packing or from fixed widget size and meter will fill all
   available space with respect to aspect ratio.
text_template::
   Like in Label sets text format for current value. Can
   be used to turn off value display.
label::
   Large label above center of meter.
sublabel::
   Small label below center of meter.
bg_color::
   Background color of meter.
z0_color, z1_color, z2_color::
   Colors of different value
   zones. Defaults are `green`, `yellow` and `red`. For description of
   zones see `z*_border` properties.
z0_border, z1_border::
   Define up bounds of color zones. By default only
   one zone is enabled. If you want more then one zone set `z0_border` and
   `z1_border` to desired values so zone 0 will fill from min to first
   border, zone 1 will fill from first to second border and zone 2 -- from
   last border to max. Borders are set as values in range min-max.

Example HAL Meters:
image:images/hal_meter.png[]

=== HAL_Graph

This widget is for plotting values over time.

[[gladevcp:hal-gremlin]]

=== Gremlin tool path preview for .ngc files

Gremlin is a plot preview widget similar to the Axis preview window.
It assumes a running LinuxCNC environment like Axis or Touchy. To connect to
it, inspects the INI_FILE_NAME environment variable. Gremlin displays
the current .ngc file - it does monitor for changes and reloads the ngc
file if the file name in Axis/Touchy changes. If you run it in a
GladeVCP application when LinuxCNC is not running, you might get a traceback
because the Gremlin widget can't find LinuxCNC status, like the current file
name.

Gremlin does not export any HAL pins. It has the following properties:

show tool speed::
    This displays the tool speed. Defaults true
show commanded::
    This selects the DRO to use commanded or actual values. Defaults true
use metric units::
    This selects the DRO to use metric or imperial units. Defaults true
show rapids::
    This tells the plotter to show the rapid moves. Defaults true
show DTG::
    This selects the DRO to display the distance-to-go value. Defaults true
show relative::
    This selects the DRO to show values relative to user system or machine 
    cordinates. Defaults true
show live plot::
    This tells the plotter to draw or not. Defaults true
show limits::
    This tells the plotter to show the machine's limits. Defaults true 
show lathe radius::
    This selects the DRO to display the X axis in radius or diameter, if in lathe
    mode (selectable in the INI file with LATHE = 1). Defaults false
show extents::
    This tells the plotter to show the extents. Defaults true
show tool::
    This tells the plotter to draw the tool. Defaults true
show program::
    TODO
use joints mode::
    Used in non trivialkins machines (eg robots). Defaults false
grid size::
    Sets the size of the grid. which is only visible in the X, Y and Z view.
    Defaults to 0
use default mouse controls::
    This disables the default mouse controls. This is most useful when using a
    touchscreen as the default controls do not work well. You can programically
    add controls using python and the handler file technique. Defaults to 'True'
view ::
   may be any of `x`, `y`, 'y2' , `z`, 'z2' , `p` (perspective) . Defaults to
   `z` view.
enable_dro ::
   boolean; whether to draw a DRO on the plot or not.
   Defaults to `True`
mouse_btn_mode ::
   integer; mouse button handling, leads to different functions of the button
   0 = default: left rotate, middle move,   right zoom
   1 =          left zoom,   middle move,   right rotate
   2 =          left move,   middle rotate, right zoom
   3 =          left zoom,   middle rotate, right move
   4 =          left move,   middle zoom,   right rotate
   5 =          left rotate, middle zoom,   right move
   6 =          left move,   middle zoom,   right zoom

   mode 6 is reccomended for plasmas and lathes, as rotation is not needed for such machines

Direct program control::

    There a couple ways to directly control the widget using Python.

    Using goobject to set the above listed properties:
        [widget name].set_property('view','P')
        [widget name].set_property('metric_units',False)
        [widget name].set_property('use_default_controls',False)
        [widget name].set_property('enable_dro' False))
        [widget name].set_property('show_program', False)
        [widget name].set_property('show_limits', False)
        [widget name].set_property('show_extents_option', False)
        [widget name].set_property('show_live_plot', False)
        [widget name].set_property('show_tool', False)
        [widget name].set_property('show_lathe_radius',True)
        [widget name].set_property('show_dtg',True)
        [widget name].set_property('show_velocity',False)
        [widget name].set_property('mouse_btn_mode', 4)

    There are python methods:
        [widget name].show_offsets = True
        [widget name].grid_size =  .75
        [widget name].select_fire(event.x,event.y)
        [widget name].select_prime(event.x,event.y)
        [widget name].start_continuous_zoom(event.y)
        [widget name].set_mouse_start(0,0)
        [widget name].gremlin.zoom_in()
        [widget name].gremlin.zoom_out()
        [widget name].get_zoom_distance()
        [widget name].set_zoom_distance(dist)
        [widget name].clear_live_plotter()
        [widget name].rotate_view(x,y)
        [widget name].pan(x,y)

Hints::
    - If you set all the plotting options false but show_offsets true you get an
    offsets page instead of a graphics plot.

    - If you get the zoom distance before changing the view then reset the zoom
    distance, it's much more user friendly.

    - if you select an element in the preview, the selected element will be used 
    as rotation center point

[[gladevcp:hal-offset]]

=== HAL_Offset

The HAL_Offset widget is used to display the offset of a single axis.
It has the following properties:

Joint Number::
    Used to select which axis (technically which joint) is displayed.
    On a trivialkins machine (mill, lathe, router) axis vrs joint number are:

    0:X  1:Y  2:Z  3:A  4:B  5:C  6:U  7:V  8:W
Text template for metric units::
    You can use python formatting to display the position with different precision.
Text template for imperial units::
    You can use python formatting to display the position with different precision.
Reference Type::
    0:G5x 1:tool 2:G92 3:Rotation around Z

[[gladevcp:dro_widget]]

=== DRO widget

The DRO widget is used to display the current axis position.
It has the following properties:

Actual Position::
    select actual (feedback) position or commanded position.
Text template for metric units::
    You can use python formatting to display the position with different precision.
Text template for imperial units::
    You can use python formatting to display the position with different precision.
Reference Type::
    Absolute <<sec.machine-corrdinate-system,(machine origin)>>, Relative
    (to current user coordinate origin - G5x)
    or Distance-to-go (relative to current user coordinate origin)
Joint Number::
    Used to select which axis (technically which joint) is displayed.
    On a trivialkins machine (mill, lathe, router) axis vrs joint number are:

    0:X  1:Y  2:Z  3:A  4:B  5:C  6:U  7:V  8:W

Display units::
    Used to toggle the display units between metric and imperial.

Hints::
    - If you want the display to be right justified, set the X align to 1.0

    - If you want different colors or size or text change the attributes in the 
    glade editor (eg scale is a good way to change the size of the text)

    - The background of the widget is actually see through - so if you place if over
    an image the DRO numbers will show on top of it with no backgroud. There is a
    special technique to do this. See the animated function diagrams below.

    - The DRO widget is a modified gtk label widget. As such much or what can be
    done to a gtk label can be done to DRO widget.

Direct program control::

    There a couple ways to directly control the widget using Python.

    Using goobject to set the above listed properties:
        [widget name].set_property("display_units_mm",True)
        [widget name].set_property("actual",True)
        [widget name].set_property("mm_text_template","%f")
        [widget name].set_property("imperial_text_template","%f")
        [widget name].set_property("Joint_number",3)
        [widget name].set_property("reference_type",3)

    There are two python methods:
        [widget name].set_dro_inch()
        [widget name].set_dro_metric()

[[gladevcp:combi_dro]]

=== Combi_DRO widget

The Combi_DRO widget is used to display the current , the relative axis position and the distance to go in one DRO. +
By clicking on the DRO the Order of the DRO will toggle around. +
In Relative Mode the actual coordinate system will be displayed.

It has the following properties:

joint_number::
    Used to select which axis (technically which joint) is displayed. +
    On a trivialkins machine (mill, lathe, router) axis vrs. joint number are: +
    '0:X  1:Y  2:Z  etc'

actual::
    select actual (feedback) or commanded position.

metric_units::
    Used to toggle the display units between metric and imperial.

auto_units::
    Units will toggle between metric and imperial according to the 
    active gcode being G20 or G21 +
    default is TRUE

diameter::
    Whether to display position as diameter or radius, in diameter mode
    the DRO will display the joint value multiplied by 2

mm_text_template::
    You can use python formatting to display the position with different precision. +
    default is "%10.3f"

imperial_text_template::
    You can use python formatting to display the position with different precision. +
    default is "%9.4f"

homed_color::
    The foreground color of the DRO numbers if the joint is homed +
    default is green

unhomed_color::
    The foreground color of the DRO numbers if the joint is not homed +
    default is red

abs_color::
    the background color of the DRO, if main DRO shows absolute coordinates +
    default is blue

rel_color::
    the background color of the DRO, if main DRO shows relative coordinates +
    default is black

dtg_color::
    the background color of the DRO, if main DRO shows distance to go +
    default is yellow

font_size::
    The font size of the big numbers, the small ones will be 2.5 times smaller,
    the value must be an integer in the range of 8 to 96, +
    default is 25

toggle_readout::
    A left mouse click will toggle the DRO readout through the different modes ["Rel", "Abs", "DTG"]. +
    By unchecking the box you can disable that behavior. The toggling can still be done with [widget name].toggle_readout() +
    Value must be bool +    
    default is TRUE

cycle_time::
    The time the DRO waits between two polls,
    the value must be an integer in the range of 100 to 1000, +
    default is 150, this setting should only be changed if you use more +
    than 5 DRO at the same time, i.e. on a 6 axis config, to avoid, that +
    the DRO slows down the main application too much.

Direct program control::
    Using gobject to set the above listed properties:

    [widget name].set_property(property, value)

There are several python methods to control the widget:

    [widget name].set_to_inch(state)
        sets the DRO to show imperial units
        state = boolean (True or False)

    [widget name].set_auto_units(state)
        if True the DRO will change units according to active gcode (G20 / G21)
        state = boolean (True or False)
        Default is True

    [widget name].set_to_diameter(state)
        if True the DRO will show the diameter not the radius, specially needed for lathes
        the DRO will display the axis value multiplied by 2
        state = boolean (True or False)
        Default is False

    [widget name].toggle_readout()
        toggles the order of the DRO in the widget

    [widget name].change_axisletter(letter)
        changes the automatically given axis letter
        very useful to change an lathe DRO from X to R or D
        letter = string

    [widget name].get_order()
        returns the order of the DRO in the widget mainly used to maintain them consistent
        the order will also be transmitted with the clicked signal
        returns a list containing the order

    [widget name].set_order(order)
        sets the order of the DRO, mainly used to maintain them consistent
        order = list object, must be one of
          ["Rel", "Abs", "DTG"]
          ["DTG", "Rel", "Abs"]
          ["Abs", "DTG", "Rel"]
        Default = ["Rel", "Abs", "DTG"]

    [widget name].get_position()
        returns the position of the DRO as a list of floats
        the order is independent of the order shown on the DRO
        and will be given as [Absolute , relative , DTG]
        Absolute = the machine coordinates, depends on the actual property
                 will give actual or commanded position
        Relative = will be the coordinates of the actual coordinate system
        DTG = the distance to go, will mostly be 0, as this function should not be used
            while the machine is moving, because of time delays

The widget will emit the following signals:

    clicked
        This signal is emitted, when the user has clicked on the Combi_DRO widget,
        it will send the following data:
        widget = widget object = The widget object that sends the signal
        joint_number = integer = The joint number of the DRO, where '0:X  1:Y  2:Z  etc'
        order = list object = the order of the DRO in that widget
                              the order may be used to set other Combi_DRO widgets to the same order with [widget name].set_order(order)

    units_changed
        This signal is emitted, if the DRO units are changed, it will send the following data:
        widget = widget object = The widget object that sends the signal
        metric_units = boolean = True if the DRO does display metric units, False in case of imperial display

    system_changed
        This signal is emitted, if the DRO units are changed, it will send the following data:
        widget = widget object = The widget object that sends the signal
        system = string = The actual coordinate system. Will be one of
                          G54 G55 G56 G57 G58 G59 G59.1 G59.2 G59.3
                          or Rel if non has been selected at all, what will only happen in Glade with no linuxcnc running

There are some information you can get through commands, witch may be of interest for you:

    [widget name].system
        The actual system, as mentioned in the system_changed signal

    [widget name].homed
        True if the joint is homed

    [widget name].machine_units
        0 if Imperial, 1 if Metric

Example, Three Combi_DRO in a window +
X = Relative Mode +
Y = Absolute Mode +
Z = DTG Mode +

    Sets the directory to start in when the widget is shown first time, +
    must be a string, containing a valid directory path, +
    default is "/"

jump_to_dir::
    Sets the directory "jump to" directory,  witch is selected by the corresponding
    button in the bottom button list, the 5th button counting from the left, +
    must be a string, containing a valid directory path, +
    default is "~"

filetypes::
    Sets the file filter for the objects to be shown +
    Must be a string containing a comma separated list of extensions to be shown +
    Default is "ngc,py"

sortorder::
    Sets the sorting order of the displayed icon
    must be an integer value from 0 to 3, where +
    0 = ASCENDING (sorted according to file names) +
    1 = DESCENDING (sorted according to file names) +
    2 = FOLDERFIRST (show the folders first, then the files) +
    3 = FILEFIRST (show the files first, then the folders), +
    Default = 2 = FOLDERFIRST



Direct program control::

Using goobject to set the above listed properties:

    [widget name].set_property(property,Value)

There are python methods to control the widget:

    [widget name].show_buttonbox(state)
        if False the bottom button box will be hidden, this is helpful in custom screens,
        with special buttons layouts to not alter the layout of the GUI, good example
        for that is gmoccapy
        state = boolean (True or False)
        Default is True

    [widget name].show_filelabel(state)
        if True the file label (between the IconView window and the bottom button box will be shown.
        Hiding this label may save place, but showing it is very useful for debugging reasons,
        state = boolean (True or False)
        Default is True

    [widget name].set_icon_size(iconsize)
        sets the icon size
        must be an integer in the range from 12 to 96
        Default = 48

    [widget name].set_directory(directory)
        Allows to set an directory to be shown
        directory = string (a valid file path)

    [widget name].set_filetypes(filetypes)
        sets the file filter to be used, only files with the given extensions will be shown
        filetypes = string containing a comma separated list of extensions
        Default = "ngc,py"

    [widget name].get_selected()
        Returns the path of the selected file, or None if an directory has been selected

    [widget name].refresh_filelist()
        Refreshes the filelist, needed if you add a file without changing the directory

If the button box has been hidden, you can reach the functions of this button
through it's clicked signals like so:

    [widget name].btn_home.emit("clicked")
    [widget name].btn_jump_to.emit("clicked")
    [widget name].btn_sel_prev.emit("clicked")
    [widget name].btn_sel_next.emit("clicked")
    [widget name].btn_get_selected.emit("clicked")
    [widget name].btn_dir_up.emit("clicked")
    [widget name].btn_exit.emit("clicked")

The widget will emit the following signals:

    selected
        This signal is emitted, when the user selects an icon, it will return a string containing a
        file path if a file has been selected, or None if an directory has been selected
    sensitive
        This signal is emitted, when the buttons change there state from sensitive to not sensitive or vice versa. 
        This signal is useful to maintain surrounding GUI synchronized with the button of the widget. See gmoccapy as example.
        It will return the buttonname and the new state. Buttonname is one of "btn_home", "btn_dir_up", "btn_sel_prev",
        "btn_sel_next", "btn_jump_to" or "btn_select". State is a boolean and will be True or False.
    exit
        This signal is Emmit, when the exit button has been pressed to close the IconView
        mostly needed if the application is started as stand alone.

       [widget name].get_preset_value()
            Returns the recorded value: a float.

[[gladevcp:tooledit]]

=== Tooleditor widget

This is a tooleditor widget for displaying and modifying a tool editor file. +
If in lathe mode, it will display wear offsets and tool offsets separately. +
Wear offsets are designated by tool number above 10000 (Fanuc style) +
Note linuxcnc requires remapping of tool calls to actually use wear offsets +
It checks the current file once a second to see if linuxcnc updated it. +
It has the following properties:

Hidden Columns::
    This will hide the given columns: The columns are designated (in order) as such: +
    s,t,p,x,y,z,a,b,c,u,v,w,d,i,j,q,; +

=== Animated function diagrams: HAL widgets in a bitmap

For some applications it might be desirable to have background image -
like a functional diagram - and position widgets at appropriate places
in that diagram. A good combination is setting a bitmap background
image, like from a .png file, making the gladevcp window fixed-size,
and use the glade Fixed widget to position widgets on this image.

The code for the below example can be found in +configs/apps/gladevcp/animated-backdrop+:

image:images/small-screenshot.png[]

== Action Widgets reference

GladeVcp includes a collection of "canned actions" called VCP Action
Widgets for the Glade user interface editor. Other than HAL widgets,
which interact with HAL pins, VCP Actions interact with LinuxCNC and the
G-code interpreter.

VCP Action Widgets are derived from the Gtk.Action widget. The Action
widget in a nutshell:

 - it is an object available in Glade
 - it has no visual appearance by itself
 -  it's purpose: associate a visible, sensitive UI component like menu,
   toolbutton, button with a command. See these widget's 'General→Related
   Action' property.
 -  the "canned action" will be executed when the associated UI component
   is triggered (button press, menu click..)
 -  it provides an easy way to execute commands without resorting to
   Python programming.

The appearance of VCP Actions in Glade is roughly as follows:

image::images/vcp-actions.png[]

Tooltip hovers provide a description.


=== VCP Action widgets

VCP Action widgets are one-shot type widgets. They implement a single action and
are for use in simple buttons, menu entries or radio/check groups.

=== VCP ToggleAction widgets

These are bi-modal widgets. They implement two actions or use a second
(usually pressed) state to indicate that currently an action is
running. Toggle actions are aimed for use in ToggleButtons,
ToggleToolButtons or toggling menu items. A simplex example is the
ESTOP toggle button.

Currently the following widgets are available:

 - The ESTOP toggle sends ESTOP or ESTOP_RESET commands to LinuxCNC depending
   on it's state.
 - The ON/OFF toggle sends STATE_ON and STATE_OFF commands.
 - Pause/Resume sends AUTO_PAUSE or AUTO_RESUME commands.

The following toggle actions have only one associated command and use
the 'pressed' state to indicate that the requested operation is
running:

 - The Run toggle sends an AUTO_RUN command and waits in the pressed
   state until the interpreter is idle again.
 - The Stop toggle is inactive until the interpreter enters the active
   state (is running G-code) and then allows user to send AUTO_ABORT
   command.
 - The MDI toggle sends given MDI command and waits for its completion in
   'pressed' inactive state.

=== The Action_MDI Toggle and Action_MDI widgets

These widgets provide a means to execute arbitrary MDI commands. The
Action_MDI widget does not wait for command completion as the
Action_MDI Toggle does, which remains disabled until command complete.

=== A simple example: Execute MDI command on button press

+configs/apps/gladevcp/mdi-command-example/whoareyou.ui+ is a Glade UI file which conveys the basics:

Open it in Glade and study how it's done. Start Axis, and then start
this from a terminal window with `gladevcp whoareyou.ui`. See the
+hal_action_mdi1+ Action and it's +MDI command+ property - this just
executes +(MSG, "Hi, I'm an VCP_Action_MDI")+ so there should be a
message popup in Axis like so:

image::images/whoareyou.png[]

You'll notice that the button associated with the Action_MDI action is
grayed out if the machine is off, in E-Stop or the interpreter is running.
It will automatically become active when the machine is turned on and
out of E-Stop, and the program is idle.

=== Parameter passing with Action_MDI and ToggleAction_MDI widgets

Optionally, 'MDI command' strings may have parameters substituted
before they are passed to the interpreter. Parameters currently may be
names of HAL pins in the GladeVCP component. This is how it works:

 - assume you have a 'HAL SpinBox' named +speed+, and you want to pass it's
   current value as a parameter in an MDI command.
 - The HAL SpinBox will have a float-type HAL pin named speed-f (see
   HalWidgets description).
 - To substitute this value in the MDI command, insert the HAL pin name
   enclosed like so: `${pin-name}`
 - for the above HAL SpinBox, we could use `(MSG, "The speed is:
   ${speed-f}")` just to show what's happening.

The example UI file is +configs/apps/gladevcp/mdi-command-example/speed.ui+. Here's what you get when running it:


image::images/speed.png[]

=== An advanced example: Feeding parameters to an O-word subroutine

It's perfectly OK to call an O-word subroutine in an MDI command, and
pass HAL pin values as actual parameters. An example UI file
is in +configs/apps/gladevcp/mdi-command-example/owordsub.ui+.

Place +nc_files/gladevcp_lib/oword.ngc+ so Axis can find it, and run `gladevcp owordsub.ui` from
a terminal window. This looks like so:

image::images/oword.png[]

=== Preparing for an MDI Action, and cleaning up afterwards

The LinuxCNC G-Code interpreter has a single global set of variables, like
feed, spindle speed, relative/absolute mode and others. If you use G
code commands or O-word subs, some of these variables might get changed
by the command or subroutine - for example, a probing subroutine will
very likely set the feed value quite low. With no further precautions,
your previous feed setting will be overwritten by the probing
subroutine's value.

To deal with this surprising and undesirable side effect of a given
O-word subroutine or G-code statement executed with an LinuxCNC
ToggleAction_MDI, you might associate pre-MDI and post-MDI handlers
with a given LinuxCNC ToggleAction_MDI. These handlers are optional and
provide a way to save any state before executing the MDI Action, and to
restore it to previous values afterwards. The signal names are +mdi-command-start+
and +mdi-command-stop+; the handler names can be set in Glade like any
other handler.

Here's an example how a feed value might be saved and restored by such
handlers (note that LinuxCNC command and status channels are available as
+self.linuxcnc+ and +self.stat+ through the VCP_ActionBase class:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
    def on_mdi_command_start(self, action, userdata=None):
        action.stat.poll()
        self.start_feed = action.stat.settings[1]
    
    def on_mdi_command_stop(self, action, userdata=None):
        action.linuxcnc.mdi('F%.1f' % (self.start_feed))
        while action.linuxcnc.wait_complete() == -1:
            pass
----------------------------------

Only the Action_MDI Toggle widget supports these signals.

[NOTE]
In a later release of LinuxCNC, the new M-codes M70-M72 are available which
make it saving state before a subroutine call, and restoring state on return much easier.

=== Using the LinuxCNC Stat object to deal with status changes

Many actions depend on LinuxCNC status - is it in manual, MDI or auto mode?
is a program running, paused or idle? You cannot start an MDI command
while a G-code program is running, so this needs to be taken care of.
Many LinuxCNC actions take care of this themselves, and related buttons and
menu entries are deactivated when the operation is currently
impossible.

When using Python event handlers - which are at a lower level than
Actions - one needs to take care of dealing with status dependencies
oneself. For this purpose, there's the LinuxCNC Stat widget: to associate
LinuxCNC status changes with event handlers.

LinuxCNC Stat has no visible component - you just add it to your UI with
Glade. Once added, you can associate handlers with its following
signals:

* state-related:     emitted when E-Stop condition occurs, is reset, machine is turned on, or is turned off
  - +state-estop+
  - +state-estop-reset+
  - +state-on+,
  - +state-off+
* mode-related:    emitted when LinuxCNC enters that particular mode
  - +mode-manual+
  - +mode-mdi+
  - +mode-auto+
* interpreter-related:  emitted when the G-code interpreter changes into that mode
  - +interp-run+
  - +interp-idle+
  - +interp-paused+
  - +interp-reading+
  - +interp-waiting+
  - +file-loaded+
  - +line-changed+
* homing-related: emitted when linuxcnc is homed or not
  - +all-homed+
  - +not-all-homed+

== GladeVCP Programming

=== User Defined Actions

Most widget sets, and their associated user interface editors, support
the concept of callbacks - functions in user-written code which are
executed when 'something happens' in the UI - events like mouse clicks,
characters typed, mouse movement, timer events, window hiding and
exposure and so forth.

HAL output widgets typically map input-type events like a button press
to a value change of the associated HAL pin by means of such a -
predefined - callback. Within PyVCP, this is really the only type of event
handling supported - doing something more complex, like executing MDI
commands to call a G-code subroutine, is not supported.

Within GladeVCP, HAL pin changes are just one type of the general
class of events (called signals) in GTK+. Most widgets may originate such
signals, and the Glade editor supports associating such a signal with a
Python method or function name.

If you decide to use user-defined actions, your job is to write a
Python module whose class methods - or in the simple case, just
functions - can be referred to in Glade as event handlers. GladeVCP
provides a way to import your module(s) at startup and will
automatically link your event handlers with the widget signals as set
in the Glade UI description.

=== An example: adding custom user callbacks in Python

This is just a minimal example to convey the idea - details are laid
out in the rest of this section.

GladeVCP can not only manipulate or display HAL pins, you can also
write regular event handlers in Python. This could be used, among
others, to execute MDI commands. Here's how you do it:

Write a Python module like so and save as e.g. handlers.py:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
nhits = 0
def on_button_press(gtkobj,data=None):
    global nhits nhits += 1 gtkobj.set_label("hits: %d" % nhits)
----------------------------------

In Glade, define a button or HAL button, select the 'Signals' tab, and
in the GtkButton properties select the 'pressed' line. Enter
'on_button_press' there, and save the Glade file.

Then add the option '-u handlers.py' to the gladevcp command line. If
your event handlers are spread over several files, just add multiple
'-u <pyfilename>' options.

Now, pressing the button should change its label since it's set in the
callback function.

What the +-u+ flag does: all Python functions in this file are
collected and setup as potential callback handlers for your Gtk widgets
- they can be referenced from Glade 'Signals' tabs. The callback
handlers are called with the particular object instance as parameter,
like the GtkButton instance above, so you can apply any GtkButton
method from there.

Or do some more useful stuff, like calling an MDI command!

=== HAL value change events

HAL input widgets, like a LED, automatically associate their HAL pin state
(on/off) with the optical appearance of the widget (LED lit/dark).

Beyond this built-in functionality, one may associate a change
callback with any HAL pin, including those of predefined HAL
widgets. This fits nicely with the event-driven structure of a typical
widget application: every activity, be it mouse click, key, timer
expired, or the change of a HAL pin's value, generates a callback and
is handled by the same orthogonal mechanism.

For user-defined HAL pins not associated with a particular HAL widget,
the signal name is 'value-changed'. See the
<<gladevcp:adding-hal-pins,Adding HAL pins>> section below for
details.

HAL widgets come with a pre-defined signal called 'hal-pin-changed'. See the
<<gladevcp:hal-pin-changed-signal,Hal Widgets section>> for details. 

=== Programming model

The overall approach is as follows:

 - design your UI with Glade, and set signal handlers where you want
   actions associated with a widget
 - write a Python module which contains callable objects (see 'handler
   models' below)
 - pass your module's path name to gladevcp with the '-u <module>' option
 - gladevcp imports the module, inspects it for signal handlers and
   connects them to the widget tree
 - the main event loop is run.

.The simple handler model

For simple tasks it's sufficient to define functions named after the
Glade signal handlers. These will be called when the corresponding
event happens in the widget tree. Here's a trivial example - it assumes
that the 'pressed' signal of a Gtk Button or HAL Button is linked to a
callback called 'on_button_press':

[source,python]
----------------------------------
nhits = 0
def on_button_press(gtkobj,data=None):
    global nhits
    nhits += 1
    gtkobj.set_label("hits: %d" % nhits)
----------------------------------

Add this function to a Python file and run as follows:

    gladevcp -u <myhandler>.py mygui.ui

Note communication between handlers has to go through global
variables, which does not scale well and is positively un-pythonic.
This is why we came up with the class-based handler model.

.The class-based handler model

The idea here is: handlers are linked to class methods. The underlying
class(es) are instantiated and inspected during GladeVCP startup and
linked to the widget tree as signal handlers. So the task now is to
write:

 -  one or more several class definition(s) with one or several methods,
   in one module or split over several modules,
 -  a function 'get_handlers' in each module which will return a list of
   class instances to GladeVCP - their method names will be linked to
   signal handlers

Here is a minimum user-defined handler example module:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
class MyCallbacks :
    def on_this_signal(self,obj,data=None):
        print "this_signal happened, obj=",obj

def get_handlers(halcomp,builder,useropts):
    return [MyCallbacks ()]
----------------------------------

Now, 'on_this_signal' will be available as signal handler to your
widget tree.

.GladeVCP-specific signals

For GladevCP panel which respond to HAL inputs it may be important that the handler
code can tell that the GladeVCP panel is currently active and displayed. For
example a panel inside the Touchy interface might well need to perform an action
when the switch connected to touchy.cycle-start is operated (in the same way
that the native tabs respond differently to the same button.)
To make this possible a signal is sent from the GUI (at the time of writing, only
Touchy) to the embedded tab. The signal is of type "Gladevcp" and the two messages
sent are "Visible" and "Hidden". (Note that the signals  have a fixed length of 20
characters so only the first characters should be used in any comparison, hence
the [:7] below.) A sample handler for these signals is:

[source, python]
----------------------------------
    # This catches our messages from another program
    def event(self,w,event):
        print event.message_type,event.data
        if event.message_type == 'Gladevcp':
            if event.data[:7] == 'Visible':
                self.active = True
            else:
                self.active = False

    # connect to client-events from the host GUI
    def on_map_event(self, widget, data=None):
        top = widget.get_toplevel()
        print "map event"
        top.connect('client-event', self.event)
----------------------------------


.The get_handlers protocol

If during module inspection GladeVCP finds a function `get_handlers`,
it calls it as follows:

    get_handlers(halcomp,builder,useropts)

the arguments are:

 - halcomp - refers to the HAL component under construction
 - builder - widget tree - result of reading the UI definition (either
   referring to a GtkBuilder or libglade-type object)
 - useropts - a list of strings collected from the gladevcp 
   command line `-U <useropts>` option

GladeVCP then inspects the list of class instances and retrieves their
method names. Qualifying method names are connected to the widget tree
as signal handlers. Only method names which do not begin with an '_'
(underscore) are considered.

Note that regardless whether you're using the libglade or the new
GtkBuilder format for your Glade UI, widgets can always be referred to
as `builder.get_object(<widgetname>)`. Also, the complete list of
widgets is available as `builder.get_objects()` regardless of UI
format.

=== Initialization sequence

It is important to know in which state of affairs your `get_handlers()`
function is called so you know what is safe to do there and what not.
First, modules are imported and initialized in command line order.
After successful import, `get_handlers()` is called in the following
state:

 -  the widget tree is created, but not yet realized (no toplevel
   `window.show()` has been executed yet)
 -  the halcomp HAL component is set up and all HAL widget's pins have
   already been added to it
 -  it is safe to add more HAL pins because `halcomp.ready()` has not yet
   been called at this point, so you may add your own pins, for instance
   in the class `__init__()` method.

Once all modules have been imported and method names extracted, the
following steps happen:

 -  all qualifying method names will be connected to the widget tree with
   `connect_signals()/signal_autoconnect()` (depending on the type of UI
   imported - GtkBuilder vs the old libglade format).
 - the HAL component is finalized with halcomp.ready()
 -  if a window ID was passed as argument, the widget tree is re-parented
   to run in this window, and Glade's toplevel window1 is abandoned (see
   FAQ)
 -  if a HAL command file was passed with `-H halfile`, it is executed
   with halcmd
 - the Gtk main loop is run.

So when your handler class is initialized, all widgets are existent
but not yet realized (displayed on screen). And the HAL component isn't
ready as well, so its unsafe to access pins values in your `__init__()`
method.

If you want to have a callback to execute at program start after it is
safe to access HAL pins, then a connect a handler to the realize signal
of the top level window1 (which might be its only real purpose). At
this point GladeVCP is done with all setup tasks, the halfile has been
run, and GladeVCP is about to enter the Gtk main loop.

=== Multiple callbacks with the same name

Within a class, method names must be unique. However, it is OK to have
multiple class instances passed to GladeVCP by get_handlers() with
identically named methods. When the corresponding signal occurs, these
methods will be called in definition order - module by module, and
within a module, in the order class instances are returned by
`get_handlers()`.

=== The GladeVCP `-U <useropts>` flag

Instead of extending GladeVCP for any conceivable option which could
potentially be useful for a handler class, you may use the -U
<useroption> flag (repeatedly if you wish). This flag collects a list
of <useroption> strings. This list is passed to the get_handlers()
function (useropts argument). Your code is free to interpret these
strings as you see fit. An possible usage would be to pass them to the
Python exec function in your `get_handlers()` as follows:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
debug = 0
...
def get_handlers(halcomp,builder,useropts):
    ...
    global debug # assuming there's a global var
    for cmd in useropts:
        exec cmd in globals()
----------------------------------

This way you can pass arbitrary Python statements to your module
through the gladevcp -U option, for example:

    gladevcp -U debug=42 -U "print 'debug=%d' % debug" ...

This should set debug to 2 and confirm that your module actually did it.

=== Persistent variables in GladeVCP

A annoying aspect of GladeVCP in its earlier form and pyvcp is the
fact that you may change values and HAL pins through text entry,
sliders, spin boxes, toggle buttons etc, but their settings are not
saved and restored at the next run of LinuxCNC - they start at the default
value as set in the panel or widget definition.

GladeVCP has an easy-to-use mechanism to save and restore the state of
HAL widgets, and program variables (in fact any instance attribute of
type int, float, bool or string).

This mechanism uses the popular '.ini' file format to save and reload
persistent attributes.

.Persistence, program versions and the signature check

Imagine renaming, adding or deleting widgets in Glade:
an .ini file lying around from a previous program version, or an
entirely different user interface, would be not be able to restore the
state properly since variables and types might have changed.

GladeVCP detects this situation by a signature which depends on all
object names and types which are saved and to be restored. In the case
of signature mismatch, a new .ini file with default settings is
generated.

=== Using persistent variables

If you want any of Gtk widget state, HAL widgets output pin's values
and/or class attributes of your handler class to be retained across
invocations, proceed as follows:

 - import the +gladevcp.persistence+ module
 - decide which instance attributes, and their default values you want to
   have retained, if any
 - decide which widgets should have their state retained
 - describe these decisions in your handler class' +__init__()+ method
   through a nested dictionary as follows:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
def __init__(self, halcomp,builder,useropts):
    self.halcomp = halcomp
    self.builder = builder
    self.useropts = useropts
    self.defaults = {
        # the following names will be saved/restored as method attributes
        # the save/restore mechanism is strongly typed - the variables type will be derived from the type of the
        # initialization value. Currently supported types are: int, float, bool, string
        IniFile.vars : { 'nhits' : 0, 'a': 1.67, 'd': True ,'c' : "a string"},
        # to save/restore all widget's state which might remotely make sense, add this:
        IniFile.widgets : widget_defaults(builder.get_objects())
        # a sensible alternative might be to retain only all HAL output widgets' state:
        # IniFile.widgets: widget_defaults(select_widgets(self.builder.get_objects(), hal_only=True,output_only = True)),
    }
----------------------------------

Then associate an .ini file with this descriptor:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
self.ini_filename = __name__ + '.ini'
self.ini = IniFile(self.ini_filename,self.defaults,self.builder)
self.ini.restore_state(self)
----------------------------------

After `restore_state()`, self will have attributes set if as running the
following:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
self.nhits = 0
self.a = 1.67
self.d = True
self.c = "a string"
----------------------------------

Note that types are saved and preserved on restore. This example
assumes that the ini file didn't exist or had the default values from
self.defaults.

After this incantation, you can use the following IniFil methods:

ini.save_state(obj)::
   saves objs's attributes as per IniFil.vars
   dictionary and the widget state as described in IniFile.widgets in
   self.defaults
ini.create_default_ini()::
   create a .ini file with default values
ini.restore_state(obj)::
  restore HAL out pins and obj's attributes as
     saved/initialized to default as above

=== Saving the state on Gladvcp shutdown

To save the widget and/or variable state on exit, proceed as follows:

- select some interior widget (type is not important, for instance a
table).
- in the 'Signals' tab, select 'GtkObject'. It should show a 'destroy'
signal in the first column.
- add the handler name, e.g. 'on_destroy' to the second column.
- add a Python handler like below:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
import gtk
...
def on_destroy(self,obj,data=None):
    self.ini.save_state(self)
----------------------------------

This will save state and shutdown GladeVCP properly, regardless
whether the panel is embedded in Axis, or a standalone window.

CAUTION: Do not use +window1+ (the toplevel window) to connect a
+destroy+ event. Due to the way a GladeVCP panel interacts with Axis
if a panel is embedded within Axis, *window1 will not receive destroy
events properly*. However, since on shutdown all widgets are
destroyed, anyone will do. Recommended: use a second-level widget -
for instance, if you have a table container in your panel, use
that.

Next time you start the GladeVCP application, the widgets should come
up in the state when the application was closed.

CAUTION: The 'GtkWidget' line has a similarly sounding 'destroy-event' -
*dont use that to connect to the 'on_destroy' handler, it wont work* -
make sure you use the 'destroy' event from the 'GtkObject' line.

=== Saving state when Ctrl-C is pressed

By default, the reaction of GladeVCP to a Ctrl-C event is to just exit
- +without+ saving state. To make sure that this case is covered, add
a handler call +on_unix_signal+ which will be automatically be called
on Ctrl-C (actuall on the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals). Example


[source,python]
----------------------------------
def on_unix_signal(self,signum,stack_frame):
    print "on_unix_signal(): signal %d received, saving state" % (signum)
    self.ini.save_state(self)
----------------------------------

=== Hand-editing .ini files

You can do that, but note that the values in self.defaults override
your edits if there is a syntax or type error in your edit. The error
is detected, a console message will hint about that happened, and the
bad inifile will be renamed to have the .BAD suffix. Subsequent bad ini
files overwrite earlier .BAD files.

[[gladevcp:adding-hal-pins]]

=== Adding HAL pins

If you need HAL pins which are not associated with a specific HAL
widget, add them as follows:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
import hal_glib
...
# in your handler class __init__():
self.example_trigger = hal_glib.GPin(halcomp.newpin('example-trigger', hal.HAL_BIT, hal.HAL_IN))
----------------------------------

To get a callback when this pin's value changes, associate a
+value-change+ callback with this pin, add:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
self.example_trigger.connect('value-changed', self._on_example_trigger_change)
----------------------------------

and define a callback method (or function, in this case leave out the
+self+ parameter):

[source,python]
----------------------------------
# note '_' - this method will not be visible to the widget tree
def _on_example_trigger_change(self,pin,userdata=None):
    print "pin value changed to:" % (pin.get())
----------------------------------

=== Adding timers

Since GladeVCP uses Gtk widgets which rely on the
http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/gobject-functions.html[GObject]
base class, the full glib functionally is available. Here is an
example for a timer callback:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
def _on_timer_tick(self,userdata=None):
    ...
    return True # to restart the timer; return False for on-shot
...
# demonstrate a slow background timer - granularity is one second
# for a faster timer (granularity 1 ms), use this:
# glib.timeout_add(100, self._on_timer_tick,userdata) # 10Hz
glib.timeout_add_seconds(1, self._on_timer_tick)
----------------------------------

=== Setting HAL widget properties programmatically

With glade, widget properties are typically set fixed while editing.
You can, however, set widget properties at runtime, for instance from
ini file values, which  would typically be done in the handler
initialization code. Setting properties from HAL pin values is
possible, too.

In the following example (assuming a HAL Meter widget called `meter`), the
meter's min value is set from an INI file parameter at startup, and the max value
is set via a HAL pin, which causes the widget's scale to readjust dynamically:

[source,python]
----------------------------------
import linuxcnc
import os
import hal
import hal_glib

class HandlerClass:

    def _on_max_value_change(self,hal_pin,data=None):
        self.meter.max = float(hal_pin.get())
        self.meter.queue_draw() # force a widget redraw

    def __init__(self, halcomp,builder,useropts):
  self.builder = builder

        # hal pin with change callback.
        # When the pin's value changes the callback is executed.
        self.max_value = hal_glib.GPin(halcomp.newpin('max-value',  hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN))
        self.max_value.connect('value-changed', self._on_max_value_change)

  inifile = linuxcnc.ini(os.getenv("INI_FILE_NAME"))
  mmin = float(inifile.find("METER", "MIN") or 0.0)
        self.meter = self.builder.get_object('meter')
        self.meter.min = mmin


def get_handlers(halcomp,builder,useropts):
    return [HandlerClass(halcomp,builder,useropts)]
----------------------------------

== FAQ

[qanda]

I get an unexpected unmap event in my handler function right after startup. What's this?::

   This is a consequence of your Glade UI file
   having the window1 Visible property set to True, together with
   re-parenting the GladeVCP window into Axis or touchy. The GladeVCP
   widget tree is created, including a top level window, and then
   'reparented into Axis', leaving that toplevel window laying around
   orphaned. To avoid having this useless empty window hanging around, it
   is unmapped (made invisible), which is the cause of the unmap signal
   you get. Suggested fix: set window1.visible to False, and ignore an
   initial unmap event.

My GladeVCP program starts, but no window appears where I expect it to be?::

   The window Axis allocates for GladeVCP will obtain the 'natural
   size' of all its child widgets combined. It's the child widget's job to
   request a size (width and/or height). However, not all widgets do
   request a width greater than 0, for instance the Graph widget in its
   current form. If there's such a widget in your Glade file and it's the
   one which defines the layout you might want to set its width
   explicitly. Note that setting the window1 width and height properties
   in Glade does not make sense because this window will be orphaned
   during re-parenting and hence its geometry will have no impact on
   layout (see above). The general rule is: if you manually run a UI file
   with 'gladevcp <uifile>' and its window has reasonable geometry, it
   should come up in Axis properly as well.

I want a blinking LED, but it wont blink::

  I ticked the checkbutton to let it blink with 100 msec interval. It
  wont blink, and I get a startup warning: Warning: value "0" of type
  `gint' is invalid or out of range for property `led-blink-rate' of
  type `gint'?  This seems to be a glade bug. Just type over the blink
  rate field, and save again - this works for me.

My gladevcp panel in Axis doesn't save state when I close Axis, although I defined an on_destroy handler linked to the window destroy signal::
   Very likely this handler is linked to window1,
   which due to reparenting isn't usable for this purpose. Please link
   the on_destroy handler to the destroy signal of an interior
   window. For instance, I have a notebook inside window1, and linked
   on_destroy to the notebooks destroy signal, and that works fine. It
   doesn't work for window1.


I want to set the background color or text of a HAL_Label widget depending on its HAL pin value::


    See the example in configs/apps/gladevcp/colored-label.  Setting the
    background color of a GtkLabel widget (and HAL_Label is derived
    from GtkLabel) is a bit tricky. The GtkLabel widget has no window
    object of its own for performance reasons, and only window objects
    can have a background color. The solution is to enclose the Label
    in an EventBox container, which has a window but is otherwise
    invisible - see the coloredlabel.ui file.


I defined a `hal_spinbutton` widget in glade, and set a default `value` property in the corresponding adjustment. It comes up with zero?::


  this is due to a bug in the old   Gtk version distributed with Ubuntu
  8.04 and 10.04, and is likely to be the case for all widgets using
  adjustment. The workaround mentione for instance in
  http://osdir.com/ml/gtk-app-devel-list/2010-04/msg00129.html does
  not reliably set the HAL pin value, it is better to set it
  explicitly in an `on_realize` signal handler during widget creation.
  See the example in `configs/apps/gladevcp/by-widget/spinbutton.{ui,py}`.


== Troubleshooting

 -  make sure you have the development version of LinuxCNC installed. You
   don't need the axisrc file any more, this was mentioned in the old
   GladeVcp wiki page.
 -  run GladeVCP or Axis from a terminal window. If you get Python errors,
   check whether there's still a +/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/hal.so+
   file lying around besides the newer
   +/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/_hal.so+ (note underscore); if yes,
   remove the +hal.so+ file. It has been superseded by hal.py in the same
   directory and  confuses the import mechanism.
 -  if you're using run-in-place, do a 'make clean' to remove any
   accidentally left over hal.so file, then 'make'.
 -  if you're using 'HAL_table' or 'HAL_HBox' widgets, be aware they have
   an HAL pin associated with it which is off by default. This pin
   controls whether these container's children are active or not.

== Implementation note: Key handling in Axis

We believe key handling works OK, but since it is new code, we're
telling about it you so you can watch out for problems; please let us
know of errors or odd behavior. This is the story:

Axis uses the TkInter widget set. GladeVCP applications use Gtk
widgets and run in a separate process context. They are hooked into
Axis with the Xembed protocol. This allows a child application like
GladeVCP to properly fit in a parent's window, and - in theory - have
integrated event handling.

However, this assumes that both parent and child application properly
support the Xembed protocol, which Gtk does, but TkInter doesn't. A
consequence of this is that certain keys would not be forwarded from a
GladeVCP panel to Axis properly under all circumstances. One of these
situations was the case when an Entry, or SpinButton widget had focus:
in this case, for instance an Escape key would not have been forwarded
to Axis and cause an abort as it should, with potentially disastrous
consequences.

Therefore, key events in GladeVCP are explicitly handled, and
selectively forwarded to Axis, to assure that such situations cannot
arise. For details, see the `keyboard_forward()` function in
`lib/python/gladevcp/xembed.py`.

== Adding Custom Widgets

The LinuxCNC Wiki has information on adding custom widgets to GladeVCP.

== Auxiliary Gladevcp Applications

Support is provided for independently installed gladevcp applications
that conform to system directory placements as defined by the
LINUXCNC_AUX_GLADEVCP and LINUXCNC_AUX_EXAMPLES items reported by
the script linuxcnc_var:

====
  $ linuxcnc_var LINUXCNC_AUX_GLADEVCP
  /usr/share/linuxcnc/aux_gladevcp
  $ linuxcnc_var LINUXCNC_AUX_EXAMPLES
  /usr/share/linuxcnc/aux_examples
====

The system directory defined by LINUXCNC_AUX_GLADEVCP
(/usr/share/linuxcnc/aux_gladevcp) specifies the location for
a gladevcp-compatible python file(s) and related subdirectories.
The python file is imported at gladevcp startup and made
available to subsequent gladevcp applications including 
embedded usage in supporting guis.

The system directory defined by LINUXCNC_AUX_EXAMPLES
(/usr/share/linuxcnc/aux_examples) specifies the location
of example configuration subdirectories used for auxiliary
applications.  See the getting-started/running-linuxcnc
section for 'Adding Configuration Selection Items'.

For testing, a runtime specification of auxiliary applications
may be specified using the exported environmental variable:
GLADEVCP_EXTRAS.  This variable should be a path list of one or
more configuration directories separated by a (:). Typically,
this variable would be set in a shell starting linuxcnc or in
a user’s ~/.profile startup script. Example:

====
  export GLADEVCP_EXTRAS=~/mygladevcp:/opt/othergladevcp
====

Files found in directories specified with the environmental
variable GLADEVCP_EXTRAS supersede identically-named files within
subdirectories of the system directory specified by
LINUXNC_AUX_GLADEVCP (e.g., /usr/share/linuxcnc/aux_gladevcp).
This provision allows a developer to test an application
by exporting GLADEVCP_EXTRAS to specify a private application
directory without removing a system-installed application directory.
Messages inidicating rejected duplicates are printed to
stdout.

[NOTE]

Support for auxiliary gladevcp applications requires a python
module named 'importlib'.  This module may not be available in
older installations like Ubuntu-Lucid.
