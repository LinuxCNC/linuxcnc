= Filter Programs

== Introduction
Most of Linuxcnc's screens have the ability to send loaded files through a 'filter program' or +
use the filter program to make Gcode. +
This filter can do any desired task: Something as simple as making sure +
the file ends with 'M2', or something as complicated as generating +
G-Code from an image. +

== Setting  up the INI for Program Filters +
The '[FILTER]'  section of the ini file controls how filters work. +
First, for each type of file, write a 'PROGRAM_EXTENSION' line. +
Then, specify the program to execute for each type of file. +
This program is given the name of the input file as its first argument, +
and must write rs274ngc code to standard output. This output is what  +
will be displayed in the text area, previewed in the display area, and +
executed by LinuxCNC when 'Run'. The following lines add support for the +
'image-to-gcode' converter included with LinuxCNC: +

----
[FILTER]
PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .png,.gif Greyscale Depth Image
png = image-to-gcode
gif = image-to-gcode
----

It is also possible to specify an interpreter:

----
PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .py Python Script
py = python
----

In this way, any Python script can be opened, and its output is +
treated as g-code. One such example script is available at +
'nc_files/holecircle.py'. This script creates g-code for drilling a +
series of holes along the circumference of a circle. +

.Circular Holes

If the filter program sends lines to stderr of the form:

----
FILTER_PROGRESS=10
----

It will set the screens progress bar to the given (10 in this case) percentage. +
This feature should be used by any filter that runs for a long time. +

== Making Python Based Filter Programs

Here is a very basic example of the filtering mechanics:
When run through a Linucnc screen that offers program filtering, +
it will produce and write a line of gcode every 100th of a second to standard output. +
It also sends a progress message out to the Unix standard error stream. +
If there was an error it would post an error message and exit with an exitcode of 1. +

import time
import sys

for i in range(0,100):
    try:
        # simulate calculation time
        time.sleep(.1)

        # output a line of gcode
        print >>sys.stdout, 'G0 X1'

        # update progress
        print >>sys.stderr, 'FILTER_PROGRESS={}'.format(i)
    except:
        # This causes an error message
        print >>sys.stderr, 'Error; But this was only a test'
        raise SystemExit(1)

Here is a similar program but it actually could filters. +
It puts up a Pyqt5 dialog with a cancel button. +
Then it reads the program line by line and passes it to standard output. +
As it does along it updates any process listening to standard error output'
