*Vismach* is a set of *Python functions that can be used to create and animate models of machines*.

This chapter is about the Qt embedded version of <<cha:vismach,Vismach>>, also see: https://sa-cnc.com/linuxcnc-vismach/ .

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:intro]]
== Introduction

Vismach displays the model in a *3D viewport* and the *model parts are animated as the values of associated HAL pins change*.

.QtVismach 3D Viewport
image::images/qtvismach.png["QtVismach 3D Viewport",align="center"]

The Vismach 3D viewport view can be manipulated as follows:

* *zoom* by _scroll wheel_
* *pan* by _middle button drag_
* *rotate* by _right-button drag_
* *tilt* by _left button drag_

A *Vismach model* takes the form of a _Python script_ and can use standard Python syntax.

This means that there is more than one way to lay out the script,
but in the examples given in this document the simplest and most basic of them will be used.

The basic sequence in creating the Vismach model is:

. Create the parts
. Define how they move
. Assemble into movement groups

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:hierarchy]]
== Hierarchy of Machine Design

The model follows *logical tree design*.

Picture the tree, with root/trunk, branches and smaller branches off it.
If you move the larger branch, smaller branches will move with it,
but if you move the smaller branch, the larger will not.

_Machine design follows that conceptual design_.

Taking the mill shown in the 3D Viewport picture above for example:

* If you move X, it can move on its own,
* but if you move Y, it will also move X assembly, as it is attached to Y assembly.

So for this machine, the tree looks like this:

----
model
  |
  |---frame
  |     |
  |     |---base
  |     |
  |     |---column
  |     |
  |     |---top
  |
  |---yassembly
  |      |
  |      |---xassembly
  |      |      |
  |      |      |---xbase
  |      |      |
  |      |      |---work
  |      |
  |      |---ybase
  |
  |---zassembly
          |
          |---zframe
          |     |
          |     |---zbody
          |     |
          |     |---spindle
          |
          |---toolassembly
                    |
                    |---cat30
                    |
                    |---tool
                         |
                         |---tooltip
                         |
                         |---(tool cylinder function)
----

As you can see, the _lowest parts must exist_ first _before those can be grouped with others into an assembly_.
So you _build upwards_ from lowest point in tree and assemble them together.

The same is applicable for any design of machine:
look at the machine arm example and you will see that it starts with the tip and adds to the larger part of the arm,
then it finally groups with the base.


[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:start]]
== Start the script

It is useful for testing to include the `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang line to _allow the file to be executed directly from the command line.

The first thing to do is to _import the required libraries_.

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import hal
import math
import sys

from qtvcp.lib.qt_vismach.qt_vismach import *
----

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:hal]]
== HAL pins.

Originally the vismach library required creating a component and connecting HAL pins to control the simulation.

`qt_vismach` can read the HAL system pins directly or if you wish, to use separate HAL pins that you must define in a HAL component:

[source,python]
----
c = hal.component("samplegui")
c.newpin("joint0", hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN)
c.newpin("joint1", hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN)
c.ready()
----

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:parts]]
== Creating Parts

[[sub:qtvcp:vismach:import]]
=== Import STL or OBJ Files

It is probably easiest to:

* _create geometry in a CAD package_
* _import into the model script using the `AsciiSTL()` or `AsciiOBJ()` functions_.

Both functions can take one of two named arguments, either a _filename_ or _data_:

[source,python]
----
part = AsciiSTL(filename="path/to/file.stl")
part = AsciiSTL(data="solid part1 facet normal ...")
part = AsciiOBJ(filename="path/to/file.obj")
part = AsciiOBJ(data="v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0 ...")
----

- STL model parts are added to the Vismach space in the _same locations as they were created in the STL or OBJ space_,
  i.e. ideally with a rotational point at their origin.

[NOTE]
It is much easier to move while building if the origin of the model is at a rotational pivot point.

[[sub:qtvcp:vismach:primitives]]
=== Build from Geometric Primitives

Alternatively parts can be _created inside the model script from a range of shape primitives_.

Many shapes are _created at the origin_ and need to be _moved to the required location_ after creation.

*`cylinder = CylinderX(x1, r1, x2, r2)`*::
*`cylinder = CylinderY(y1, r1, y2, r2)`*::
*`cylinder = CylinderZ(z1, r1, z2, r2)`*::
  Creates a _(optionally tapered) cylinder on the given axis_ with the given radii at the given points on the axis.
*`sphere = Sphere(x, y, z, r)`*::
  Creates a _sphere of radius r at (x,y,z)_.
*`triangle = TriangleXY(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, z1, z2)`*::
*`triangle = TriangleXZ(x1, z1, x2, z2, x3, z3, y1, y2)`*::
*`triangle = TriangleYZ(y1, z1, y2, z2, y3, z3, x1, x2)`*::
  Creates a _triangular plate between planes_ defined by the last two values parallel to the specified plane,
  with vertices given by the three coordinate pairs.
*`arc = ArcX(x1, x2, r1, r2, a1, a2)`*::
  Create an _arc shape_.
*`box = Box(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)`*::
  Creates a _rectangular prism with opposite corners_ at the specified positions and edges parallel to the XYZ axes.
*`box = BoxCentered(xw, yw, zw)`*::
  Creates an xw by yw by zw _box centred on the origin_.
*`box = BoxCenteredXY(xw, yw, z)`*::
  Creates a _box ground on WY plane_ of width xw / yw and height z.

Composite parts may be created by assembling these primitives either at creation time or subsequently:

[source,python]
----
part1 = Collection([Sphere(100,100,100,50), CylinderX(100,40,150,30)])
part2 = Box(50,40,75,100,75,100)
part3 = Collection([part2, TriangleXY(10,10,20,10,15,20,100,101)])
part4 = Collection([part1, part2])
----

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:move]]
== Moving Model Parts

Parts may need to be moved in the Vismach space to assemble the model.
The origin does not move - Translate() and Rotate() move the Collection as you add parts, relative to a stationary origin.

//FIXME unclear
They may also need to be moved to create the animation as the animation rotation axis is created at the origin (but moves with the Part).

[[sub:qtvcp:vismach:translate]]
=== Translating Model parts

*`part1 = Translate([part1], x, y, z)`*:: Move part1 the specified distances in x, y and z.

[[sub:qtvcp:vismach:rotate]]
=== Rotating Model Parts

*`part1 = Rotate([part1], theta, x, y, z)`*::
  Rotate the part by angle theta [degrees] about an axis between the origin and x, y, z.

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:animate]]
== Animating Parts

//FIXME 2 or 3 functions ? HalToolCylinder not documented here ?
To *animate the model controlled by the values of HAL pins* there are four functions:
`HalTranslate`, `HalRotate`, `HalToolCylinder` and `HalToolTriangle`.

_For parts to move inside an assembly they need to have their HAL motions defined before being assembled with the "Collection" command_.

The *rotation axis and translation vector move with the part*:

* as it is moved by the Vismach script during model assembly, or
* as it moves in response to the HAL pins as the model is animated.

[[sub:qtvcp:vismach:haltranslate]]
=== `HalTranslate`

*`part = HalTranslate([part], hal_comp, hal_pin, xs, ys, zs)`*::
  `part`;; A _collection or part_. +
    It can be pre-created earlier in the script, or could be created at this point if preferred, e.g., +
+
[source,python]
----
`part1 = HalTranslate([Box(....)], ...)`. +
----
  `hal_comp`;; The _HAL component_ is the next argument. +
    In QtVCP if you are reading _system pins_ directly then the component argument is set to `None`. +
  `hal_pin`;; The _name of the HAL pin_ that will animate the motion. +
    This needs to match an existing HAL pin that describes the joint position such as:
+
[source,{hal}]
----
"joint.2.pos-fb"
----
+
Otherwise the component instance would be specified and the pin name of that component would be specified.
  `xs, ys, zs`;; The _X, Y, Z scales_. +
    For a Cartesian machine created at 1:1 scale this would typically be `1,0,0` for a motion in the positive X direction. +
    However if the STL file happened to be in cm and the machine was in inches,
    this could be fixed at this point by using 0.3937 ( = 1&#8239;cm/1&#8239;inch = 1&#8239;cm /2.54&#8239;cm ) as the scale.

[[sub:qtvcp:vismach:halrotate]]
=== `HalRotate`

*`part = HalRotate([part], hal_comp, hal_pin, angle_scale, x, y, z)`*::
  This command is similar in its operation to `HalTranslate`,
  except that it is typically necessary to move the part to the origin first to define the axis. +
  `x, y, z`;; Defines the _axis of rotation_ from the origin the point of coordinates (x,y,z). +
    When the part is moved back away from the origin to its correct location,
    the axis of rotation can be considered to remain "embedded" in the part.
  `angle_scale`;; _Rotation angles_ are in degrees, so for a rotary joint with a 0-1 scaling you would need to use an angle scale of 360.

=== 'HalToolCylinder'

*`tool = HalToolCylinder()`*::
 Make a cylinder to represent a cylindrical mill tool, based on the tool table and current loaded tool.

[source,python]
----
tool = HalToolCylinder()
toolshape = Color([1, .5, .5, .5],[tool])

# or more compact:
toolshape = Color([1, .5, .5, .5], [HalToolCylinder()])
----

=== 'HalToolTriangle'

*`tool = HalToolTriangle()`*::
 Make a triangle to represent a triangular lathe tool, based on the tool table and current loaded tool.

[source,python]
----
tool = HalToolTriangle()
toolshape = Color([1, 1, 0, 1],[tool])

# or more compact:
toolshape = Color([1, 1, 0, 1],[HalToolTriangle()])
----

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:assembly]]
== Assembling the model

In order for parts to move together they need to be assembled with the *`Collection()` command*.

It is important to *assemble the parts and define their motions in the correct sequence*.

For example to create a moving head milling machine with a rotating spindle and an animated draw bar you would:

* Create the head main body.
* Create the spindle at the origin.
* Define the rotation.
* Move the head to the spindle or spindle to the head.
* Create the draw bar.
* Define the motion of the draw bar.
* Assemble the three parts into a head assembly.
* Define the motion of the head assembly.

In this example the spindle rotation is indicated by rotation of a set of drive dogs:

[source,python]
----
#Drive dogs
dogs = Box(-6,-3,94,6,3,100)
dogs = Color([1,1,1,1],[dogs])
dogs = HalRotate([dogs],c,"spindle",360,0,0,1)
dogs = Translate([dogs],-1,49,0)

#Drawbar
draw = CylinderZ(120,3,125,3)
draw = Color([1,0,.5,1],[draw])
draw = Translate([draw],-1,49,0)
draw = HalTranslate([draw],c,"drawbar",0,0,1)

# head/spindle
head = AsciiSTL(filename="./head.stl")
head = Color([0.3,0.3,0.3,1],[head])
head = Translate([head],0,0,4)
head = Collection([head, tool, dogs, draw])
head = HalTranslate([head],c,"Z",0,0,0.1)

# base
base = AsciiSTL(filename="./base.stl")
base = Color([0.5,0.5,0.5,1],[base]) 
# mount head on it
base = Collection([head, base])
----

Finally a *single collection of all the machine parts, floor and work* (if any) needs to be created.

For a _serial machine_ each new part will be added to the collection of the previous part.

For a _parallel machine_ there may be several "base" parts.

Thus, for example, in `scaragui.py` link3 is added to link2, link2 to link1 and link1 to link0,
so the final model is created by:

[source,python]
----
model = Collection([link0, floor, table])
----

Whereas a VMC model with separate parts moving on the base might have

[source,python]
----
model = Collection([base, saddle, head, carousel])
----

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:functions]]
== Other functions

*`part = Color([_colorspec_], [_part_])`*::
  Sets the _display color of the part_. +
  Note that unlike the other functions, the part definition comes second in this case. +
  `_colorspec_`;; Three RGB values and opacity. +
  For example [1,0,0,0.5] for a 50% opacity red.

*`myhud = Hud()`*::
  Creates a _heads-up display_ in the Vismach GUI to display items such as axis positions, titles, or messages.
[source,python]
----
myhud = Hud()
myhud.show("Mill_XYZ")`
----

*`myhud = HalHud()`*::
  A more advanced version of the Hud that allows HAL pins to be displayed:
[source,python]
----
myhud = HalHud()
myhud.set_background_color(0,.1,.2,0)
myhud.show_top("Mill_XYZ")
myhud.show_top("------------")
myhud.add_pin('axis-x: ',"{:10.4f}","axis.x.pos-cmd")
myhud.add_pin('axis-y: ',"{:10.4f}","axis.y.pos-cmd")
myhud.add_pin('axis-z: ',"{:10.4f}","axis.z.pos-cmd")
myhud.show("-------------")
----

*`part = Capture()`*::
  This sets the current position in the model.

*`main(model, tooltip, work, size=10, hud=myhud, rotation_vectors=None, lat=0, lon=0)`*::
  This is the command that makes it all happen, creates the display, etc. if invoked directly from Python.
  Usually this file is imported by QtVCP and the `window()` object is instantiated and embedded into another screen.
  `_model_`;; Should be a collection that contains all the machine parts.
  `_tooltip_` and `_work_`;; Need to be created by `Capture()` to visualize their motion in the backplot.
    See `mill_xyz.py` for an example of how to connect the tool tip to a tool and the tool to the model.
  `_size_`;; Sets the extent of the volume visualized in the initial view. +
    hud refers to a head-up display of axis positions.
  `_rotation_vectors_` or `_lat, lon_`;; Can be used to set the original viewpoint.
    It is advisable to do as the default initial viewpoint is rather unhelpful from immediately overhead.


== Tips

Create an axes origin marker to be able to see parts relative to it, for construction purposes.
You can remove it when you are done.

[source,python]
----
# build axis origin markers
X = CylinderX(-500,1,500,1)
X = Color([1, 0, 0, 1], [X])
Y = CylinderY(-500,1,500,1)
Y = Color([0, 1, 0, 1], [Y])
Z = CylinderZ(-500,1,500,1)
Z = Color([0, 0, 1, 1], [Z])
origin = Collection([X,Y,Z])
----

Add it to the Window class Collection so it is never moved from the origin.

[source,python]
----
v.model = Collection([origin, model, world])
----

Start from the cutting tip and work your way back.
Add each collection to the model at the origin and run the script to confirm the location,
then rotate/translate and run the script to confirm again.

[[sec:qtvcp:vismach:structure]]
== Basic structure of a `QtVismach` script
