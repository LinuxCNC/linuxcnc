= Touchy

Touchy is a user interface for EMC2 meant for use on machine control panels,
and therefore does not require keyboard or mouse.

It is meant to be used with a touch screen, and works in combination
with a wheel/MPG and a few buttons and switches.

== Panel Configuration

=== HAL connections

Touchy requires that you create a file named `touchy.hal` in your
configuration directory (the directory your ini file is in) to 
connect its controls. Touchy executes the HAL commands in this file
after it has made its own pins available for connection.

Touchy has several output pins that are meant to be connected to the
motion controller to control wheel jogging:

 - `touchy.jog.wheel.increment`,
	which is to be connected to the `axis.N.jog-scale` pin of each axis N.

 - `touchy.jog.wheel.N`, which is to be connected to `axis.N.jog-enable`
	for each axis N.

 - In addition to being connected to `touchy.wheel-counts`, the wheel counts 
	should also be connected to `axis.N.jog-counts` for 
	each axis N.  If you use HAL component `ilowpass` to smooth wheel jogging, be
	sure to smooth only `axis.N.jog-counts` and not `touchy.wheel-counts`.

==== Required controls

 - Abort button (momentary contact) connected to the HAL pin `touchy.abort`
 - Cycle start button (momentary contact) connected to `touchy.cycle-start`
 - Wheel/MPG, connected to `touchy.wheel-counts` and motion pins as described above
 - Single block (toggle switch) connected to `touchy.single-block`

==== Optional controls

 -  For continuous jog, one center-off bidirectional momentary toggle
   (or two momentary buttons) for each axis, hooked to `touchy.jog.continuous.x.negative`,
   `touchy.jog.continuous.x.positive`, etc.
 -  If a quill up button is wanted (to jog Z to the top of travel at top
   speed), a momentary button connected to `touchy.quill-up`.

==== Optional panel lamps

 - `touchy.jog.active` shows when the panel jogging controls are live
 - `touchy.status-indicator` is on when the machine is executing G-code,
    and flashes when the machine is executing but is in pause/feedhold.

=== Recommended for any setup

 - Estop button hardwired in the estop chain

== Setup

To use Touchy, in the `[DISPLAY]` section of your ini file change the
display selector line to `DISPLAY = touchy`

When you start Touchy the first time, check the Preferences tab.
If using a touchscreen, choose the option to hide the pointer for
best results.

The Status Window is a fixed height, set by the size of a fixed font. 
This can be affected by the Gnome DPI. If the bottom of the screen is 
cut off return the Gnome DPI to the orignal setting of 96 dots per inch.
