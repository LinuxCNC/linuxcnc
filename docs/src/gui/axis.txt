= AXIS GUI

== Introduction

AXIS is a graphical front-end for LinuxCNC which features a live
preview and backplot. It is written in Python and uses
Tk and OpenGL to display its user interface.

.AXIS Window

image::images/axis.png[align="center", alt="AXIS Window"]

== Getting Started

If your configuration is not currently set up to use AXIS, 
you can change it by editing the .ini file. In the
section '[DISPLAY]' change the 'DISPLAY' line to read
'DISPLAY = axis'.

The sample configuration
'sim/axis.ini' is already configured to use AXIS as its front-end.

=== A Typical Session

 . Start LinuxCNC.
 . Reset E-STOP (F1) and turn the Machine Power (F2) on.
 . Home all axes.
 . Load the g-code file.
 . Use the preview plot to verify that the program is correct.
 . Load the material.
 . Set the proper offset for each axis by jogging and using the Touch
   Off button as needed.
 . Run the program.

[NOTE]
To run the same program again depends on your setup and requirements.
You might need to load more material and set offsets or move over and
set an offset then run the program again. If your material is fixtured
then you might need to only run the program again. See the
<<sub:axis-machine-menu,Machine Menu>> for more information on the run
command.

== AXIS Display

The AXIS window contains the following elements:

* A display area that shows one of the following:
 ** a preview of the loaded file (in this case,
   'axis.ngc'), as well as the current location of the CNC
   machine's 'controlled point'. Later, this area will display the path
   the CNC machine has moved through, called the 'backplot'
 ** a large readout showing the current position and all offsets.
* A menu bar and toolbar that allow you to perform various actions
* 'Manual Control Tab' - which allows you to make the
 machine move, turn the spindle on or off, and turn the coolant on or
 off if included in the ini file.
* 'MDI Tab' - where G-code programs can be entered manually,
 one line at a time. This also shows the 'Active G Codes' which shows
 which modal G Codes are in effect.
* 'Feed Override' - which allows you to scale
 the speed of programmed motions. The default maximum is 120% 
 and can be set to a different
 value in the ini file. See the <<sec:display-section,Display Section>> of the
 INI file for more information.
* 'Spindle Override' - which allows you to
 scale the spindle speed up or down.
* 'Jog Speed' - which allows you to set the jog speed
 within the limits set in the ini file. See the 
 <<sec:display-section,Display Section>> of the INI file for more information.
* 'Max Velocity' - which allows you to restrict the maximum velocity of all
 programmed motions (except spindle synchronized motion).
* A text display area that shows the loaded G-Code.
* A status bar which shows the state of the machine. In this screen
 shot, the machine is turned on, does not have a tool inserted, and the
 displayed position is 'Relative' (showing all offsets), and 'Actual'
 (showing feedback position).

=== Menu Items

Some menu items might be grayed out depending on how you have your
.ini file configured. For more information on configuration see the
<<cha:ini-configuration,INI Chapter>>.

.File Menu

* 'Open...' - Opens a standard dialog box to open a g code file to load in AXIS. If
    you have configured LinuxCNC to use a filter program you can also open it
    up. See the <<sec:filter-section,FILTER Section>> of the INI configuration
    for more information.

* 'Recent Files' - Displays a list of recently opened files.

* 'Edit...' - Open the current G code file for editing if you have an editor
    configured in your ini file. See the <<sec:display-section,DISPLAY Section>>
    for more information on specifying an editor to use.

* 'Reload' - Reload the current g code file. If you edited it you must reload it
    for the changes to take affect. If you stop a file and want to start
    from the beginning then reload the file. The toolbar reload is the same
    as the menu.

* 'Save gcode as...' - Save the current file with a new name.

* 'Properties' - The sum of the rapid and feed moves. Does not factor in 
    acceleration, blending or path mode so time reported will never
    be less than the actual run time.

* 'Edit tool table...' - Same as Edit if you have defined an editor
   you can open the tool table and edit it.

* 'Reload tool table' - After editing the tool table you must reload it.

* 'Ladder editor' - If you have loaded Classic Ladder you can edit it from
   here. See the <<cha:classicladder,Classicladder Chapter>>
   for more information.

* 'Quit' - 
    Terminates the current LinuxCNC session.

[[sub:axis-machine-menu]]

.Machine Menu

* 'Toggle Emergency Stop F1' - Change the state of the Emergency Stop.

* 'Toggle Machine Power F2' - Change the state of the Machine Power if
   the Emergency Stop is not on.

* 'Run Program' - Run the currently loaded program from the beginning.

* 'Run From Selected Line' - Select the line you want to start from first.
   Use with caution as this will move the tool to the expected position before
   the line first then it will execute the rest of the code.

[WARNING]
Do not use 'Run From Selected Line' if your g code program contains subroutines.

* 'Step' - Single step through a program.

* 'Pause' - Pause a program.

* 'Resume' - Resume running from a pause.

* 'Stop' - Stop a running program. When run is selected after a stop the program
           will start from the beginning.

* 'Stop at M1' - If an M1 is reached, and this is checked, program execution
    will stop on the M1 line. Press Resume to continue.

* 'Skip lines with "/"' - If a line begins with '/' and this is checked, 
   the line will be skipped.

* 'Clear MDI history' - Clears the MDI history window.

* 'Copy from MDI history' - Copies the MDI history to the clipboard

* 'Paste to MDI history' - Paste from the clipboard to the MDI history window

* 'Calibration' - Starts the Calibration assistant (emccalib.tcl).
   Calibration reads the HAL file and for every 'setp' that uses a variable
   from the ini file that is in an [AXIS_L],[JOINT_N], or [TUNE]
   section it creates an entry that can be edited and tested.

* 'Show HAL Configuration' - Opens the HAL Configuration window where you can
   monitor HAL Components, Pins, Parameters, Signals, Functions, and Threads.

* 'HAL Meter' - Opens a window where you can monitor a single HAL Pin, Signal, or
    Parameter.

* 'HAL Scope' - Opens a virtual oscilloscope that allows plotting HAL values vs. time.

* 'Show LinuxCNC Status' - Opens a window showing LinuxCNC's status.

* 'Set Debug Level' - Opens a window where debug levels can be viewed and some can be set.

* 'Homing' - Home one or all axes.

* 'Unhoming' - Unhome one or all axes.

* 'Zero Coordinate System' - Set all offsets to zero in the coordinate
  system chosen.

[[axis:tool-touch-off]] (((Axis, Tool Touch Off)))

* 'Tool touch off to workpiece' - When performing Touch Off, the value
entered is relative to the current workpiece ('G5x') coordinate system,
as modified by the axis offset ('G92').  When the Touch Off is complete,
the Relative coordinate for the chosen axis will become the value entered.
See <<gcode:g10-l10,G10 L10>> in the G code chapter.

* 'Tool touch off to fixture' - When performing Touch Off, the value entered
is relative to the ninth ('G59.3') coordinate system, with the axis offset
('G92') ignored.  This is useful when there is a tool touch-off fixture at a
fixed location on the machine, with the ninth ('G59.3') coordinate system set
such that the tip of a zero-length tool is at the fixture's origin when the
Relative coordinates are 0.  See <<gcode:g10-l11,G10 L11>> in the G code chapter.

.View Menu

* 'Top View' - The Top View (or Z view) displays the G code looking along the
  Z axis from positive to negative. This view is best for looking at X & Y.

* 'Rotated Top View' - The Rotated Top View (or rotated Z view) also displays
  the G code looking along the Z axis from positive to negative. But sometimes
  it's convenient to display the X & Y axes rotated 90 degrees to fit the
  display better. This view is also best for looking at X & Y. 

* 'Side View' - The Side View (or X view) displays the G code looking along
  the X axis from positive to negative. This view is best for looking at Y & Z.

* 'Front View' - The Front View (or Y view) displays the G code looking along
  the Y axis from negative to positive. This view is best for looking at X & Z.

* 'Perspective View' - The Perspective View (or P view) displays the G code
  looking at the part from an adjustable point of view, defaulting to X+, Y-,
  Z+. The position is adjustable using the mouse and the drag/rotate selector.
  This view is a compromise view, and while it does do a good job of trying to
  show three (to nine!) axes on a two-dimensional display, there will often be
  some feature that is hard to see, requiring a change in viewpoint. This view
  is best when you would like to see all three (to nine) axes at once.

.Point of View
****
The AXIS display pick menu 'View' refers to 'Top', 'Front', and 'Side' views.
These terms are correct if the CNC machine has its Z axis vertical, with
positive Z up. This is true for vertical mills, which is probably the most
popular application, and also true for almost all EDM machines, and even
vertical turret lathes, where the part is turning below the tool.

The terms 'Top', 'Front', and 'Side' might be confusing however, in other
CNC machines, such as a standard lathe, where the Z axis is horizontal, or
a horizontal mill, again where the Z axis is horizontal, or even an inverted
vertical turret lathe, where the part is turning above the tool, and the Z axis
positive direction is down!

Just remember that positive Z axis is (almost) always away from the part.
So be familiar with your machine's design and interpret the display as needed.
****


* 'Display Inches' - Set the AXIS display scaling for inches. 

* 'Display MM' - Set the AXIS display scaling for millimeters. 

* 'Show Program' - The preview display of the loaded G code program can be entirely 
    disabled if desired. 

* 'Show Program Rapids' - The preview display of the loaded G code program will always show the 
    feedrate moves (G1,G2,G3) in white. But the display of rapid moves (G0) 
    in cyan can be disabled if desired. 

* 'Alpha-blend Program' - This option makes the preview of complex programs easier to see, but 
    may cause the preview to display more slowly.

* 'Show Live Plot' - The highlighting of the feedrate paths (G1,G2,G3) as the tool moves 
    can be disabled if desired. 

* 'Show Tool' - The display of the tool cone/cylinder can be disabled if desired. 

* 'Show Extents' - The display of the extents (maximum travel in each axis direction) 
    of the loaded G code program can be disabled if desired. 

* 'Show Offsets' - The selected fixture offset (G54-G59.3) origin location can be shown 
    as a set of three orthogonal lines, one each of red, blue, and green. 
    This offset origin (or fixture zero) display can be disabled if desired. 

* 'Show Machine Limits' - The machine's maximum travel limits for each axis, as set in the ini 
    file, are shown as a rectangular box drawn in red dashed lines. This 
    is useful when loading a new G code program, or when checking for how 
    much fixture offset would be needed to bring the G code program within 
    the travel limits of your machine. It can be shut off if not needed. 

* 'Show Velocity' - A display of velocity is sometimes useful to see how close your 
    machine is running to its design velocities. It can be disabled 
    if desired.  

* 'Show Distance to Go' - Distance to go is a very handy item to know when running an unknown 
    G code program for the first time. In combination with the rapid 
    override and feedrate override controls, unwanted tool 
    and machine damage can be avoided. Once the G code program has 
    been debugged and is running smoothly, the Distance to Go display 
    can be disabled if desired. 

* 'Clear Live Plot' - As the tool travels in the Axis display, the G code path is highlighted. 
    To repeat the program, or to better see an area of interest, the 
    previously highlighted paths can be cleared.     

* 'Show Commanded Position' - This is the position that LinuxCNC will try to go to. Once motion 
    has stopped, this is the position LinuxCNC will try to hold. 

* 'Show Actual Position' - Actual Position is the measured position as read back from the 
    system's encoders or simulated by step generators. This may differ 
    slightly from the Commanded Position for many reasons including PID 
    tuning, physical constraints, or position quantization.

* 'Show Machine Position' - This is the position in unoffset coordinates, as established by Homing.
    
* 'Show Relative Position' - This is the Machine Position modified by 'G5x', 'G92', and 'G43' offsets.
    
.Help Menu

=== Graphical Display Area

.Coordinate Display

In the upper-left corner of the program display is the coordinate position
display for each axis. To the right of the number an origin symbol
image:images/axis-homed.png[alt="origin symbol is shown if the axis has been homed"] is shown if the axis has been homed.

A limit symbol image:images/axis-limit.png[alt="limit symbol"] is shown on the right side of the
coordinate position number if the axis is on one of its limit switches.

To properly interpret the coordinate position numbers, refer to the 'Position:'
indicator in the status bar. If the position is 'Machine Actual', then the
displayed number is in the machine coordinate system. If it is
'Relative Actual', then the displayed number is in the offset coordinate
system. When the coordinates displayed are relative and an offset has been set,
the display will include a cyan <<sec.machine-corrdinate-system,'machine origin'>>
image:images/axis-machineorigin.png[alt="cyan machine origin"] marker.

If the position is 'Commanded', then the exact coordinate given in a G code
command is displayed. If it is 'Actual', then it is the position the machine
has actually moved to. These values can be different from commanded postition
due to following error, dead band, encoder resolution, or step size. For
instance, if you command a movement to X 0.0033 on your mill, but one step of
your stepper motor or one encoder count is 0.00125, then the 'Commanded'
position might be 0.0033, but the 'Actual' position will be 0.0025 (2 steps)
or 0.00375 (3 steps).

.Preview Plot

When a file is loaded, 
a preview of it is shown in the display area.
Fast moves (such as those produced by the 'G0' command) are shown as
cyan lines. Moves at a feed rate 
(such as those produced by the 'G1' command) are 
shown as solid white lines. Dwells 
(such as those produced by the 'G4' command) 
are shown as small pink 'X' marks.

G0 (Rapid) moves prior to a feed move 
will not show on the preview plot. 
Rapid moves after a T<n> (Tool Change) will not show on the 
preview until after the first feed move. 
To turn either of these features off
program a G1 without any moves prior to the G0 moves.

.Program Extents

The 'extents' of the program in each axis are shown. 
At the ends, the least and greatest coordinate values are indicated. 
In the middle, the difference between the coordinates is shown. 

When some coordinates exceed the 'soft limits' in the .ini file, 
the relevant dimension is shown in a different color and enclosed by a box.
In figure below the maximum soft limit is exceeded on
the X axis as indicated by the box surrounding the coordinate value.
The minimum X travel of the program is -1.95, 
the maximum X travel is 1.88, 
and the program requires 3.83 inches of X travel.  
To move the program so it's within the machine's travel in this case, 
jog to the left and Touch Off X again.

image::images/axis-outofrange.png[align="center",alt="The extents of the program in x axis are shown"]

.Tool Cone
When no tool is loaded, the location of the tip of the tool is
indicated by the 'tool cone'.
The 'tool cone' does not provide guidance on the form,
length, or radius of the tool.

When a tool is loaded (for instance, with the MDI command 'T1 M6' ),
the cone changes to a cylinder which shows the diameter of the tool
given in the tool table file.

.Backplot

When the machine moves, it leaves a trail called the backplot. 
The color of the line indicates the type of motion: 
Yellow for jogs, faint green for rapid movements, 
red for straight moves at a feed rate, 
and magenta for circular moves at a feed rate.

.Grid

Axis can optionally display a grid when in orthogonal views.  Enable
or disable the grid using the 'Grid' menu under 'View'.  When
enabled, the grid is shown in the top and rotated top views; when
coordinate system is not rotated, the grid is shown in the front and
side views as well.  The presets in the 'Grid' menu are controlled
by the inifile item `[DISPLAY]GRIDS`; if unspecified, the default is
`10mm 20mm 50mm 100mm 1in 2in 5in 10in`.

Specifying a very small grid may decrease performance.

.Interacting

By left-clicking on a portion of the preview plot, 
the line will be highlighted 
in both the graphical and text displays. 
By left-clicking on an empty area, the highlighting will be removed.

By dragging with the left mouse button pressed, 
the preview plot will be shifted (panned).

By dragging with shift and the left mouse button pressed, 
or by dragging with the mouse wheel pressed, 
the preview plot will be rotated. 
When a line is highlighted, 
the center of rotation is the center of the line. 
Otherwise, the center of rotation is 
the center of the entire program. 

By rotating the mouse wheel, 
or by dragging with the right mouse button pressed, 
or by dragging with control and the left mouse button pressed, 
the preview plot will be zoomed in or out.

By clicking one of the 'Preset View' icons, 
or by pressing 'V', several preset views may be selected.

=== Text Display Area

By left-clicking a line of the program, the line will be highlighted
in both the graphical and text displays.

When the program is running, the line currently being executed is
highlighted in red. If no line has been selected by the user, 
the text display will automatically scroll to show the current line.

.Current and Selected Lines

image::images/axis-currentandselected.png[align="center", alt="Current and Selected Lines"]

=== Manual Control

While the machine is turned on but not running a program, 
the items in the 'Manual Control' tab can be used to 
move the machine or control its spindle and coolant. 

When the machine is not turned on, or when a program is running, the
manual controls are unavailable.

Many of the items described below are not useful on all machines. 
When AXIS detects that a particular pin is not connected in HAL, 
the corresponding item in the Manual Control tab is removed. 
For instance, if the HAL pin 'spindle.0.brake' is not connected, 
then the 'Brake' button will not appear on the screen. 
If the environment variable 'AXIS_NO_AUTOCONFIGURE' is set, 
this behavior is disabled and all the items will appear. 

.The Axis group

'Axis' allows you to manually move the machine. 
This action is known as 'jogging'. 
First, select the axis to be moved by clicking it. 
Then, click and hold the '+' or '-' button 
depending on the desired direction of motion. 
The first four axes can also be moved by 
the arrow keys (X and Y), 
PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys (Z), 
and the [ and ] keys (A).

If 'Continuous' is selected, the motion will continue 
as long as the button or key is pressed. 
If another value is selected, 
the machine will move exactly the displayed distance 
each time the button is clicked or the key is pressed. 
By default, the available values are '0.1000, 0.0100, 0.0010, 0.0001'

See the <<sec:display-section,DISPLAY Section>> for more information on setting
the increments.

.Homing (Identity Kinematics)

The inifile setting [KINS]JOINTS defines the total number of
joints for the system.  A joint may be configured with
a home switch or for 'immediate' homing.  Joints may specify
a home sequence that organizes the order for homing groups
of joints.

If *all* joints are configured for homing and have valid
home sequences, the homing button will show 'Home All'.  Pressing
the 'Home All' button (or the Ctrl-HOME key) will initiate homing
for all joints using their defined home sequences.  Pressing the
HOME key will home the joint corresponding to the currently
selected axis even if no homing sequence is defined.

If not all axes have valid home sequences, the homing button will
show 'Home Axis' and will home the joint for the currently
selected axis only.  Each axis must be selected and homed
separately.

The dropdown menu Machine/Homing provides an alternate method to
home axes. The dropdown menu Machine/Unhoming provides means to
unhome axes.

See the <<cha:homing-configuration,Homing Configuration Chapter>> for more
information.

.Homing (Non-Identity Kinematics)

Operation is similar to that for Identity Kinematics but, prior to
homing, the selection radiobuttons select joints by number.  The
homing button will show 'Home All' if all joints are configured
for homing and have valid home sequences.  Otherwise, the homing
button will show 'Home Joint'.

See the <<cha:homing-configuration,Homing Configuration Chapter>> for more
information.

.Touch Off

By pressing 'Touch Off' or the END key, the 'G5x offset' for the
current axis is changed so that the current axis value will be the
specified value. Expressions may be entered using the rules for
rs274ngc programs, except that variables may not be referred to. The
resulting value is shown as a number.

.Touch Off

image::images/touchoff.png[align="center", alt="Touch Off"]

See also the 'Tool touch off to workpiece' and 'Tool touch off to fixture' 
options in the Machine menu.

.Override Limits

By pressing Override Limits, the machine will temporarily be allowed
to jog off of a physical limit switch. This check box is only available
when a limit switch is tripped.  The override is reset after one jog.  If
the axis is configured with separate positive and negative limit switches,
LinuxCNC will allow the jog only in the correct direction.  _Override Limits will
not allow a jog past a soft limit.  The only way to disable a soft limit 
on an axis is to Unhome it._

.The Spindle group

The buttons on the first row select the direction for the spindle to
rotate: Counterclockwise, Stopped, Clockwise. Counterclockwise will
only show up if the pin 'spindle.0.reverse' is in the HAL file (it
can be 'net trick-axis spindle.0.reverse' ). The buttons on the
next row increase or decrease the rotation
speed. The checkbox on the third row allows the spindle brake to be
engaged or released. Depending on your machine configuration, not all
the items in this group may appear. Pressing the spindle start button
sets the 'S' speed to 1.

.The Coolant group

The two buttons allow the 'Mist' and 'Flood' coolants to be turned on
and off. Depending on your machine configuration, not all the items in
this group may appear.

=== MDI

MDI allows G-code commands to be entered manually.
When the machine is not turned on, or when a program is
running, the MDI controls are unavailable.

.The MDI tab

image::images/axis-mdi.png[align="center", alt="MDI tab"]

* 'History' - This shows MDI commands that have been typed earlier in this session.

* 'MDI Command' - This allows you to enter a g-code command to be executed. Execute the
    command by pressing Enter or by clicking 'Go'.

* 'Active G-Codes' - This shows the 'modal codes' that are active in the interpreter. For
    instance, 'G54' indicates that the 'G54 offset' is applied to all
    coordinates that are entered. When in Auto the Active G-Codes represent
    the codes after any read ahead by the interpreter.

=== Feed Override

By moving this slider, the programmed feed rate can be modified. For
instance, if a program requests 'F60' and the slider is set to 120%,
then the resulting feed rate will be 72.

=== Spindle Speed Override

By moving this slider, the programmed spindle speed can be
modified. For instance, if a program requests S8000 and the slider is
set to 80%, then the resulting spindle speed will be 6400. This item
only appears when the HAL pin 'spindle.0.speed-out' is connected.

=== Jog Speed

By moving this slider, the speed of jogs can be modified. For
instance, if the slider is set to 1 in/min, then a .01 inch jog will
complete in about .6 seconds, or 1/100 of a minute. Near the left side
(slow jogs) the values are spaced closely together, while near the
right side (fast jogs) they are spaced much further apart, allowing a
wide range of jog speeds with fine control when it is most important.

On machines with a rotary axis, a second jog speed slider is shown.
This slider sets the jog rate for the rotary axes (A, B and C).

=== Max Velocity

By moving this slider, the maximum velocity can be set. This caps the
maximum velocity for all programmed moves except spindle-synchronized
moves.

== Keyboard Controls

Almost all actions in AXIS can be accomplished with the keyboard. A
full list of keyboard shortcuts can be found in the AXIS Quick
Reference, which can be displayed by choosing Help > Quick Reference.
Many of the shortcuts are unavailable when in MDI mode.

.Feed Override Keys

The Feed Override keys behave differently when in Manual Mode. The
keys '12345678 will select an axis if it is programed. If you have 3
axis then ' will select axis 0, 1 will select axis 1, and 2 will select
axis 2. The remainder of the number keys will still set the Feed
Override. When running a program '1234567890 will set the Feed Override
to 0% - 100%.

The most frequently used keyboard shortcuts are shown in the following Table 

.Most Common Keyboard Shortcuts

|====================================================================

== Show LinuxCNC Status (linuxcnctop)

AXIS includes a program called 'linuxcnctop' which shows some of the
details of LinuxCNC's state. You can run this program by invoking Machine >
Show LinuxCNC Status

.LinuxCNC Status Window

image::images/axis-emc-status.png[align="center", alt="LinuxCNC Status Window"]

The name of each item is shown in the left column. The current value
is shown in the right column. If the value has recently changed, it is
shown on a red background.

== MDI interface

AXIS includes a program called `mdi` which allows text-mode entry of
MDI commands to a running LinuxCNC session. You can run this program by
opening a terminal and typing

    mdi

Once it is running, it displays the prompt 'MDI>'. When a blank line
is entered, the machine's current position is shown. 
When a command is entered, it is sent to LinuxCNC to be executed.

This is a sample session of mdi.

----
$ mdi
MDI>
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 
MDI> G1 F5 X1 
MDI>  
(0.5928500000000374, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 
MDI>  
(1.0000000000000639, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
----

== axis-remote

AXIS includes a program called 'axis-remote' which can send certain
commands to a running AXIS. The available commands are shown by running
'axis-remote --help' and include checking whether AXIS is running
('--ping'), loading a file by name, reloading the currently loaded
file ('--reload'), and making AXIS exit ('--quit').

[[sec:manual-tool-change]](((Axis, Manual Tool Change)))

== Manual Tool Change

LinuxCNC includes a userspace HAL component called 'hal_manualtoolchange',
which shows a window prompt telling you what tool is expected when a
'M6' command is issued. After the OK button is pressed, execution of
the program will continue.

The hal_manualtoolchange component includes a hal pin for a button that
can be connected to a physical button to complete the tool change and
remove the window prompt (hal_manualtoolchange.change_button).

The HAL configuration file 'lib/hallib/axis_manualtoolchange.hal'
shows the HAL commands necessary to use this component.

hal_manualtoolchange can be used even when AXIS is not used as the GUI. 
This component is most useful if you have presettable tools and
you use the tool table.

[NOTE]
Important Note: Rapids will not show on the preview after 
a T<n> is issued until the next feed move after the M6. 
This can be very confusing to most users. 
To turn this feature off for the current tool change 
program a G1 with no move after the T<n>.

.The Manual Toolchange Window

image::images/manual-tool-change.png[align="center", alt="The Manual Toolchange Window"]

== Python modules 

AXIS includes several Python modules which may be useful to others. For more
information on one of these modules, use 'pydoc <module name>' or read the
source code. These modules include:

 - 'emc' provides access to the LinuxCNC command, status, and error channels
 - 'gcode' provides access to the rs274ngc interpreter
 - 'rs274' provides additional tools for working with rs274ngc files
 - 'hal' allows the creation of userspace HAL components written in Python
 - '_togl' provides an OpenGL widget that can be used in Tkinter applications
 - 'minigl' provides access to the subset of OpenGL used by AXIS

To use these modules in your own scripts, you must ensure that the
directory where they reside is on Python's module path. When running an
installed version of LinuxCNC, this should happen automatically. When
running 'in-place', this can be done by using
'scripts/rip-environment'.

== Using AXIS in Lathe Mode

By including the line 'LATHE = 1' 
in the [DISPLAY] section of the ini file, AXIS selects lathe mode. The
'Y' axis is not shown in coordinate readouts, the view is changed to
show the Z axis extending to the right and the X axis extending towards
the bottom of the screen, and several controls (such as those for
preset views) are removed.  The coordinate readouts for X are replaced
with diameter and radius.

Pressing 'V' zooms out to show the entire file, if one is loaded.

When in lathe mode, the shape of the loaded tool (if any) is shown.

.Lathe Tool Shape

image::images/axis-lathe-tool.png[align="center", alt="Lathe Tool Shape"]

== Using AXIS in Foam Cutting mode

By including the line 'FOAM = 1'
in the [DISPLAY] section of the ini file, AXIS selects foam-cutting mode.
In the program preview, XY motions are displayed in one plane, and UV motions
in another.  In the live plot, lines are drawn between corresponding points on
the XY plane and the UV plane.  The special comments (XY_Z_POS) and (UV_Z_POS)
set the Z coordinates of these planes, which default to 0 and 1.5 machine units.

.Foam cutting mode

image::images/axis-foam.png[align="center", alt="Foam cutting mode"]


== Advanced Configuration

When AXIS is started it creates the HAL pins for the GUI then it executes
the HAL file named in '[HAL]POSTGUI_HALFILE' in the ini file. Only one post
GUI file may be used. Place all HAL commands that connect to the GUI HAL pins
in the post gui HAL file.

For more information on ini file settings that can change how AXIS
works see the <<sec:display-section,Display Section>> of the INI 
Configuration Chapter.

=== Program Filters

AXIS has the ability to send loaded files through a 'filter program'.
This filter can do any desired task: Something as simple as making sure
the file ends with 'M2', or something as complicated as generating
G-Code from an image.

The '[FILTER]'  section of the ini file controls how filters work. 
First, for each type of file, write a 'PROGRAM_EXTENSION' line. 
Then, specify the program to execute for each type of file. 
This program is given the name of the input file as its first argument,
and must write rs274ngc code to standard output. This output is what
will be displayed in the text area, previewed in the display area, and
executed by LinuxCNC when 'Run'. The following lines add support for the
'image-to-gcode' converter included with LinuxCNC:

----
[FILTER]
PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .png,.gif Greyscale Depth Image
png = image-to-gcode
gif = image-to-gcode
----

It is also possible to specify an interpreter:

----
PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .py Python Script
py = python
----

In this way, any Python script can be opened, and its output is
treated as g-code. One such example script is available at
'nc_files/holecircle.py'. This script creates g-code for drilling a
series of holes along the circumference of a circle.

.Circular Holes

image::images/holes.png[align="center", alt="Circular Holes"]

If the environment variable AXIS_PROGRESS_BAR is set, then lines
written to stderr of the form

----
FILTER_PROGRESS=%d
----

will set the AXIS progress bar to the given percentage. This feature
should be used by any filter that runs for a long time.

=== The X Resource Database

The colors of most elements of the AXIS user interface can be
customized through the X Resource Database. The sample file
'axis_light_background' changes the colors of the backplot window to a
'dark lines on white 
background' scheme, and also serves as a reference for the configurable
items in the display area. The sample file 'axis_big_dro' changes the
position readout to a larger size font. To use these files:

----
xrdb -merge /usr/share/doc/emc2/axis_light_background

xrdb -merge /usr/share/doc/emc2/axis_big_dro
----
For information about the other items which can be configured in Tk
applications, see the Tk man pages.

Because modern desktop environments automatically make some settings
in the X Resource Database that adversely affect AXIS, by default these
settings are ignored. To make the X Resource Database items override
AXIS defaults, include the following line in your X Resources:

// These asterisks are not for bold, 
----
    *Axis*optionLevel: widgetDefault
----
// in this case, we want the asterisks to actually appear. 

this causes the built-in options to be created at the option level
'widgetDefault', so that X Resources (which are level 'userDefault')
can override them.

=== ~/.axisrc

If it exists, the contents of `~/.axisrc`  are executed as Python
source code just before the AXIS GUI is
displayed. The details of what may be written in the `~/.axisrc` are subject
to change during the development cycle.

The following adds Control-Q as a keyboard shortcut for Quit.

----
root_window.bind("<Control-q>", "destroy .")
help2.append(("Control-Q", "Quit"))
----

The following stops the "Do you really want to quit" dialog.

----
root_window.tk.call("wm","protocol",".","WM_DELETE_WINDOW","destroy .") 
----

=== USER_COMMAND_FILE

A configuration-specific python file may be specified with an ini file
setting '[DISLAY]USER_COMMAND_FILE=filename.py'.  Like a `~/.axisrc` file,
this file is sourced just before the AXIS GUI is displayed.  This file
is specific to an ini file configuration not the user's home directory.
When this file is specified, an existing `~/.axisrc` file is ignored.

=== user_live_update()

The axis gui includes a no-op (placeholder) function named
'user_live_update()' that is executed at the conclusion of the update()
function of its LivePlotter class.  This function may be implemented
within a `~/.axisrc` python script or a '[DISPLAY]USER_COMMAND_FILE'
python script to make custom, periodic actions.  The details of what may
be accomplished in this function are dependent on the axis gui
implementation and subject to change during the development cycle.

=== user_hal_pins()

The axis gui includes a no-op (placeholder) function named
'user_hal_pins()'. +
It is executed just after the .axisrc file is called and 
just before any gladevcp panels / embedded tabs are initialized. +
This function may be implemented
within a `~/.axisrc` python script or a '[DISPLAY]USER_COMMAND_FILE'
python script to make custom HAL pins that use the 'axisui.' prefix. +
Use 'comp' as the HAL component instance reference. +
HAL comp.ready() is called just after this function returns.

=== External Editor

The menu options File > Edit... and File > Edit Tool Table... become
available after defining the editor in the ini section [DISPLAY].
Useful values include EDITOR=gedit and EDITOR=gnome-terminal -e vim.
For more information, see the <<sec:display-section,Display Section>>
of the INI Configuration Chapter.

=== Virtual Control Panel

AXIS can display a custom virtual control panel in the right-hand
pane. You can program buttons, indicators, data displays and more. For
more information, see the <<cha:pyvcp,PyVCP Chapter>> and the 
<<cha:glade-vcp,GladeVCP Chapter>>.

[[axis:preview-control]]

=== Preview Control

Special comments can be inserted into the G Code file to control how
the preview of AXIS behaves. In the case where you want to limit the
drawing of the preview use these special comments. Anything between the
(AXIS,hide) and (AXIS,show) will not be drawn during the preview. The
(AXIS,hide) and (AXIS,show) must be used in pairs with the (AXIS,hide)
being first. Anything after a (AXIS,stop) will not be drawn during the
preview.

These comments are useful to unclutter the preview display (for
instance while debugging a larger g-code file, one can disable the
preview on certain parts that are already working OK).

 - (AXIS,hide) Stops the preview (must be first)
 - (AXIS,show) Resumes the preview (must follow a hide)
 - (AXIS,stop) Stops the preview from here to the end of the file.
 - (AXIS,notify,the_text) Displays the_text as an info display
This display can be useful in the Axis preview when (debug,message)
comments are not displayed.

=== Axisui Pins

To improve the interaction of AXIS with physical jog wheels, the axis
currently selected in the GUI is also reported on a pin with a name
like 'axisui.jog.x'. One of these pins is 'TRUE' at one time, and the rest are
'FALSE'. These are meant to control motion's jog-enable pins.

.Axisui Pins

Axis has Hal pins to indicate which jog radio button is selected in the
'Manual Control' tab.

----
Type  Dir    Name
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.x
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.y
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.z
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.a
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.b
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.c
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.u
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.v
bit   OUT    axisui.jog.w
----

Axis has a Hal pin to indicate the jog increment selected on the 'Manual Tab'.
----
Type  Dir    Name
float OUT               axisui.jog.increment
----

Axis has Hal input pins to clear the pop up notifications for errors and
information.

----
Type  Dir    Name
bit   IN     axisui.notifications-clear
bit   IN     axisui.notifications-clear-error
bit   IN     axisui.notifications-clear-info
----

Axis has a Hal input pin that disables/enables the 'Pause/Resume' funtion.
----
Type  Dir    Name
bit   IN     axisui.resume-inhibit
----

== Axis Customization Hints

Axis is a fairly large and difficult-to-penetrate code base, this is helpful 
To keep the code stable but makes it difficult to customize. +
Here we will show code snippets to modify behaviours or visuals of the screen.
Keep in mind the internal code of AXIS can change from time to time. +
these snippets are not guaranteed to continue to work - they may need adjustment.

=== The update function

There is a function in Axis named user_live_update that is called
every time Axis updates itself. You can use this to update your own functions. 
[source,python]
----

# continuous update function
def user_live_update():
    print 'i am printed every update...'
