== F: Set Feed Rate[[sec:F-feed-rate]]
(((F: Set Feed Rate)))

* 'F-' - sets the feed rate. The application of the feed rate is as described in the
<<sub:feed-rate,Feed Rate>> Section, unless inverse time feed rate mode is in effect,
in which case the feed rate is as described in 
the <<sec:G93-G94-G95-Mode,G93 G94 G95>> Section.

== S: Set Spindle Speed[[sec:S-spindle-speed]]
(((S: Set Spindle Speed)))

* 'S-' - set the speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) of the spindle.
The spindle will turn at that speed when a 'M3' or 'M4' is in effect.
It is OK to program an S word whether the spindle is turning or not.
If the speed override switch is enabled and not set at 100%, 
the speed will be different from what is programmed. 
It is OK to program S0, the spindle will not turn if that is done.

It is an error if:

* the S number is negative.

As described in the <<sec:G84-Right-Hand-Tapping,G84>> Section, if a 'G84'
(tapping) canned cycle is active and the feed and speed override
switches are enabled, the one set at the lower setting will take
effect. The speed and feed rates will still be synchronized. In this
case, the speed may differ from what is programmed, even if the speed
override switch is set at 100%.

== T: Select Tool[[sec:T-Select-Tool]]
(((T: Select Tool)))

* 'T-' - call tool prepare. The tool is 
not changed until an 'M6' is programmed (see Section 
<<sec:M6-Tool-Change,M6>>). The T word may 
appear on the same line as the 'M6' or on a previous line. It is OK
if T words appear on two or more lines with no tool change. Only the
the most recent T word will take effect at the next
tool change. It is OK to program 'T0'; no tool will be selected. This
is useful if you want the spindle to be empty after a tool change.

It is an error if:

* a negative T number is used, 
* or a T number larger than the number of slots in the carousel is used.

On some machines, the carousel will move when a T word is programmed,
at the same time machining is occurring. On such machines, programming
the T word several lines before a tool change will save time. A common
programming practice for such machines is to put the T word for the
next tool to be used on the line after a tool change. This maximizes
the time available for the carousel to move.

Rapid moves after a 'T<n>' will not show on the AXIS preview until after
a feed move. This is for machines that travel long distances to change
the tool like a lathe. This can be very confusing at first. To turn
this feature off for the current tool program a G1 without any
move after the 'T<n>'.
