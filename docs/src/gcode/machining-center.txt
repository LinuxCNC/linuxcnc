= CNC Machine Overview

This section gives a brief description of how a CNC machine is viewed
from the input and output ends of the Interpreter.

== Mechanical Components

A CNC machine has many mechanical components that may be controlled or
may affect the way in which control is exercised. This section
describes the subset of those components that interact with the
Interpreter. Mechanical components that do not interact directly with
the Interpreter, such as the jog buttons, are not described here, even
if they affect control.

=== Axes

Any CNC machine has one or more Axes. Different types of CNC machines
have different combinations. For instance, a '4-axis milling machine'
may have XYZA or XYZB axes. A lathe typically has XZ axes. A
foam-cutting machine may have XYUV axes. In LinuxCNC, the case of a XYYZ
'gantry' machine with two motors for one axis is better handled by
kinematics rather than by a second linear axis. footnote:[If the 
motion of mechanical components is not independent, as with 
hexapod machines, the RS274/NGC language and the canonical machining
functions will still be usable, as long as the lower levels of control
know how to control the actual mechanisms to produce the same relative
motion of tool and workpiece as would be produced by independent axes.
This is called 'kinematics'.]

.Primary Linear Axes (((axes, primary linear)))

The X, Y, and Z axes produce linear motion in three mutually
orthogonal directions.

.Secondary Linear Axes (((axes, secondary linear)))

The U, V, and W axes produce linear motion in three mutually
orthogonal directions. Typically, X and U are parallel, Y and V are
parallel, and Z and W are parallel.

.Rotational Axes (((axes, rotational)))

The A, B and C axes produce angular motion (rotation). Typically, A
rotates around a line parallel to X, B rotates around a line parallel
to Y, and C rotates around a line parallel to Z.

=== Spindle (((spindle)))

A CNC machine typically has a spindle which holds one cutting tool,
probe, or the material in the case of a lathe. The spindle may or may
not be controlled by the CNC software.
LinuxCNC offers suport for up to 8 spindles, which can be individually
controlled and can run simultaneously at different speeds and in different
directions. 

=== Coolant (((coolant)))

If a CNC machine has components to provide mist coolant and/or flood
coolant they can be controlled by G codes.

=== Feed and Speed Override

A CNC machine can have separate feed and speed override controls,
which let the operator specify that the actual feed rate or spindle
speed used in machining at some percentage of the programmed rate.

=== Block Delete Switch

A CNC machine can have a block delete switch. See the
<<sub:block-delete-switch,Block Delete>> Section.

=== Optional Program Stop Switch

A CNC machine can have an optional program stop switch. See the 
<<sub:optional-program-stop,Optional Program Stop>> Section.

== Control and Data Components

=== Linear Axes

The X, Y, and Z axes form a standard right-handed coordinate system of
orthogonal linear axes. Positions of the three linear motion mechanisms
are expressed using coordinates on these axes.

The U, V and W axes also form a standard right-handed coordinate
system. X and U are parallel, Y and V are parallel, and Z and W are
parallel (when A, B, and C are rotated to zero).

=== Rotational Axes

The rotational axes are measured in degrees as wrapped linear axes in
which the direction of positive rotation is counterclockwise when
viewed from the positive end of the corresponding X, Y, or Z-axis. By
'wrapped linear axis', we mean one on which the angular position
increases without limit (goes towards plus infinity) as the axis turns
counterclockwise and deceases without limit (goes towards minus
infinity) as the axis turns clockwise. Wrapped linear axes are used
regardless of whether or not there is a mechanical limit on rotation.

Clockwise or counterclockwise is from the point of view of the
workpiece. If the workpiece is fastened to a turntable which turns on a
rotational axis, a counterclockwise turn from the point of view of the
workpiece is accomplished by turning the turntable in a direction that
(for most common machine configurations) looks clockwise from the point
of view of someone standing next to the machine. footnote:[If the
parallelism requirement is violated, the system builder will
have to say how to distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise.]

=== Controlled Point

The controlled point is the point whose position and rate of motion
are controlled. When the tool length offset is zero (the default
value), this is a point on the spindle axis (often called the gauge
point) that is some fixed distance beyond the end of the spindle,
usually near the end of a tool holder that fits into the spindle. The
location of the controlled point can be moved out along the spindle
axis by specifying some positive amount for the tool length offset.
This amount is normally the length of the cutting tool in use, so that
the controlled point is at the end of the cutting tool. On a lathe,
tool length offsets can be specified for X and Z axes, and the
controlled point is either at the tool tip or slightly outside it
(where the perpendicular, axis-aligned lines touched by the 'front' and
'side' of the tool intersect).

=== Coordinated Linear Motion

To drive a tool along a specified path, a machining center must often
coordinate the motion of several axes. We use the term 'coordinated
linear motion' to describe the situation in which, nominally, each axis
moves at constant speed and all axes move from their starting positions
to their end positions at the same time. If only the X, Y, and Z axes
(or any one or two of them) move, this produces motion in a straight
line, hence the word 'linear' in the term. In actual motions, it is
often not possible to maintain constant speed because acceleration or
deceleration is required at the beginning and/or end of the motion. It
is feasible, however, to control the axes so that, at all times, each
axis has completed the same fraction of its required motion as the
other axes. This moves the tool along same path, and we also call this
kind of motion coordinated linear motion.

Coordinated linear motion can be performed either at the prevailing
feed rate, or at traverse rate, or it may be synchronized to the
spindle rotation. If physical limits on axis speed make the desired
rate unobtainable, all axes are slowed to maintain the desired path.

[[sub:feed-rate]](((Feed Rate)))

=== Feed Rate

The rate at which the controlled point moves is nominally a steady
rate which may be set by the user. In the Interpreter, the feed
rate is interpreted as follows (unless 'inverse time feed' or 'feed
per revolution' modes are being used, in which case see Section
<<gcode:g93-g94-g95,G93-G94-G95-Mode,G93 G94 G95>>).

 .  If any of XYZ are moving, F is in units per minute in the XYZ
   cartesian system, and all other axes (ABCUVW) move so as to start and
   stop in coordinated fashion. 
 .  Otherwise, if any of UVW are moving, F is in units per minute in the
   UVW cartesian system, and all other axes (ABC) move so as to start and
   stop in coordinated fashion. 
 .  Otherwise, the move is pure rotary motion and the F word is in rotary
   units in the ABC 'pseudo-cartesian' system.

=== Coolant (((coolant)))

Flood coolant and mist coolant may each be turned on independently.
The RS274/NGC language turns them off together see Section 
<<mcode:m7-m8-m9,M7 M8 M9>>.

=== Dwell (((dwell)))

A machining center may be commanded to dwell (i.e., keep all axes
unmoving) for a specific amount of time. The most common use of dwell
is to break and clear chips, so the spindle is usually turning during a
dwell. Regardless of the Path Control Mode (see Section 
<<sec:path-control-mode,Path Control>>) the machine will stop exactly at the end of
the previous programmed move, as though it was in exact path mode.

=== Units (((units)))

Units used for distances along the X, Y, and Z axes may be measured in
millimeters or inches. Units for all other quantities involved in
machine control cannot be changed. Different quantities use different
specific units. Spindle speed is measured in revolutions per minute.
The positions of rotational axes are measured in degrees. Feed rates
are expressed in current length units per minute, or degrees per
minute, or length units per spindle revolution, as described in Section 
<<gcode:g93-g94-g95,G93 G94 G95>>. 

=== Current Position

The controlled point is always at some location called the 'current
position', and the controller always knows where that is. The numbers
representing the current position must be adjusted in the absence of
any axis motion if any of several events take place:

 . Length units are changed.
 . Tool length offset is changed.
 . Coordinate system offsets are changed. 

=== Selected Plane

There is always a 'selected plane', which must be the XY-plane, the
YZ-plane, or the XZ-plane of the machining center. The Z-axis is, of
course, perpendicular to the XY-plane, the X-axis to the YZ-plane, and
the Y-axis to the XZ-plane.

=== Tool Carousel

Zero or one tool is assigned to each slot in the tool carousel.

=== Tool Change

A machining center may be commanded to change tools.

=== Pallet Shuttle

The two pallets may be exchanged by command.

[[sec:path-control-mode]](((Path Control Mode)))

=== Path Control Mode

The machining center may be put into any one of three path control
modes: (1) exact stop mode, (2) exact path mode, or (3) continuous mode
with optional tolerance. In exact stop mode, the machine stops briefly
at the end of each programmed move. In exact path mode, the machine
follows the programmed path as exactly as possible, slowing or stopping
if necessary at sharp corners of the path. In continuous mode, sharp
corners of the path may be rounded slightly so that the feed rate may
be kept up (but by no more than the tolerance, if specified). See
Sections <<gcode:g61,G61>> and <<gcode:g64,G64>>.

== Interpreter Interaction with Switches

The Interpreter interacts with several switches. This section
describes the interactions in more detail. In no case does the
Interpreter know what the setting of any of these switches is.

=== Feed and Speed Override Switches

The Interpreter will interpret RS274/NGC commands which enable 'M48'
or disable 'M49' the feed and speed override switches. For certain
moves, such as the
traverse out of the end of a thread during a threading cycle, the
switches are disabled automatically.

LinuxCNC reacts to the speed and feed override settings when these
switches are enabled.

See the <<mcode:m48-m49,M48 M49 Override>> section for more
information.

[[sub:block-delete-switch]]

=== Block Delete Switch

If the block delete switch is on, lines of G code which start
with a slash (the block delete character) are not interpreted. If the
switch is off, such lines are interpreted. Normally the block delete
switch should be set before starting the NGC program.

[[sub:optional-program-stop]]

=== Optional Program Stop Switch

If this switch is on and an M1 code is encountered, program execution
is paused.

== Tool Table

A tool table is required to use the Interpreter. The file tells which 
tools are in which tool changer slots and what the size and type of 
each tool is. The name of the tool table is defined in the ini file: 

----
[EMCIO]

# tool table file
TOOL_TABLE = tooltable.tbl
----

The default filename probably looks something like the above, but 
you may prefer to give your machine its own tool table, using the 
same name as your ini file, but with a tbl extension: 

----
TOOL_TABLE = acme_300.tbl
----

or

----
TOOL_TABLE = EMC-AXIS-SIM.tbl
----

For more information on the specifics of the tool table format, 
see the <<sec:tool-table,Tool Table Format>> Section. 

== Parameters

In the RS274/NGC language view, a machining center maintains an array
of numerical parameters defined by a system definition
(RS274NGC_MAX_PARAMETERS). Many of them have specific uses especially
in defining coordinate systems. The number of numerical parameters can
increase as development adds support for new parameters. The parameter
array persists over time, even if the machining center is powered down.
LinuxCNC uses a parameter file to ensure persistence and gives the
Interpreter the responsibility for maintaining the file. The
Interpreter reads the file when it starts up, and writes the file when
it exits.

All parameters are available for use in G code programs.

The format of a parameter file is shown in the following table.
The file consists of any number of
header lines, followed by one blank line, followed by any number of
lines of data. The Interpreter skips over the header lines. It is
important that there be exactly one blank line (with no spaces or tabs,
even) before the data. The header line shown in the following table 
describes the data columns, so it is
suggested (but not required) that that line always be included in the
header.

The Interpreter reads only the first two columns of the table. The
third column, 'Comment', is not read by the Interpreter.

Each line of the file contains the index number of a parameter in the
first column and the value to which that parameter should be set in the
second column. The value is represented as a double-precision floating
point number inside the Interpreter, but a decimal point is not
required in the file. All of the parameters shown in the following table 
are required parameters and must be
included in any parameter file, except that any parameter representing
a rotational axis value for an unused axis may be omitted. An error
will be signaled if any required parameter is missing. A parameter
file may include any other parameter, as long as its number is in the
range 1 to 5400. The parameter numbers must be arranged in ascending
order. An error will be signaled if not. Any parameter included in the
file read by the Interpreter will be included in the file it writes as
it exits. The original file is saved as a backup file when the new file
is written. Comments are not preserved when the file is written.
