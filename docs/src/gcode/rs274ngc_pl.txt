== Changes from RS274/NGC

.Differences that change the meaning of RS274/NGC programs

Location after a tool change::

In LinuxCNC, the machine does not return to its original position 
after a tool change. This change was made because the new tool 
might be longer than the old tool, and the move to the original 
machine position could therefore leave the tool tip too low.

Offset parameters are inifile units::

In LinuxCNC, the values stored in parameters for the G28 and G30 home 
locations, the P1...P9 coordinate systems, and the G92 offset are 
in "inifile units". This change was made because otherwise the 
meaning of a location changed depending on whether G20 or G21 was 
active when G28, G30, G10 L2, or G92.3 is programmed.

Tool table lengths/diameters are in inifile units::

In LinuxCNC, the tool lengths (offsets) and diameters in the tool 
table are specified in inifile units only. This change was made 
because otherwise the length of a tool and its diameter would 
change based on whether G20 or G21 was active when initiating 
G43, G41, G42 modes. This made it impossible to run gcode in the 
machine's non-native units, even when the gcode was simple and 
well-formed (starting with G20 or G21, and didn't change units 
throughout the program), without changing the tool table.

G84, G87 not implemented::

G84 and G87 are not currently implemented, but may be added to a 
future release of LinuxCNC.

G28, G30 with axis words::

When G28 or G30 is programmed with only some axis words present, 
LinuxCNC only moves the named axes. This is common on other machine 
controls. To move some axes to an intermediate point and then 
move all axes to the predefined point, write two lines of gcode:
+
G0 X- Y- (axes to move to intermediate point) G28 (move all axes 
to predefined point)

== Additions to RS274/NGC

.Differences that do not change the meaning of RS274/NGC programs

G33, G76 threading codes::

These codes are not defined in RS274/NGC.

G38.2::

The probe tip is not retracted after a G38.2 movement. This 
retraction move may be added in a future release of LinuxCNC.

G38.3...G38.5::

These codes are not defined in RS274/NGC

O-codes::

These codes are not defined in RS274/NGC

M50...M53 overrides::

These codes are not defined in RS274/NGC

M61..M66::

These codes are not defined in RS274/NGC

G43, G43.1::

'Negative Tool Lengths'
+
The RS274/NGC spec says "it is expected that" all tool lengths 
will be positive. However, G43 works for negative tool lengths.
+
'Lathe tools'
+
G43 tool length compensation can offset the tool in both the X 
and Z dimensions. This feature is primarily useful on lathes.
+
'Dynamic tool lengths'
+
LinuxCNC allows specification of a computed tool length through G43.1 
I K.

G41.1, G42.1::

LinuxCNC allows specification of a tool diameter and, if in lathe 
mode, orientation in the gcode. The format is G41.1/G42.1 D L, 
where D is diameter and L (if specified) is the lathe tool 
orientation.

G43 without H word::

In ngc, this is not allowed. In LinuxCNC, it sets length offsets for 
the currently loaded tool. If no tool is currently loaded, it is 
an error. This change was made so the user doesn't have to 
specify the tool number in two places for each tool change, and 
because it's consistent with the way G41/G42 work when the D word 
is not specified.

U, V, and W axes::

LinuxCNC allows machines with up to 9 axes by defining an additional 
set of 3 linear axes known as U, V and W
