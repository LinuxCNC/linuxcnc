== M0, M1 Program Pause[[sec:M0-M1]]
(((M0 Program Pause)))(((M1 Program Optional Pause)))

* 'M0' - pause a running program temporarily. LinuxCNC remains
         in the Auto Mode so MDI and other manual actions
         are not enabled. Pressing the cycle start button
         will restart the program at the following line.

* 'M1' - pause a running program temporarily if the optional
         stop switch is on. LinuxCNC remains in the Auto Mode
         so MDI and other manual actions are not enabled.
         Pressing the cycle start button
         will restart the program at the following line.

[NOTE]
It is OK to program 'M0' and 'M1' in MDI mode,
but the effect will probably not be noticeable,
because normal behavior in MDI mode is 
to stop after each line of input anyway.

== M2, M30 Program End[[sec:M2-M30]]
(((M2 Program End)))(((M30 Program End)))

* 'M2' - end the program. Pressing cycle start will
         start the program at the beginning of the file.
         
* 'M30' - exchange pallet shuttles and end the program.
          Pressing cycle start will start the program
          at the beginning of the file.

Both of these commands have the following effects:

. Change from Auto mode to MDI mode.
. Origin offsets are set to the default (like 'G54').
. Selected plane is set to XY plane (like 'G17').
. Distance mode is set to absolute mode (like 'G90').
. Feed rate mode is set to units per minute (like 'G94').
. Feed and speed overrides are set to ON (like 'M48').
. Cutter compensation is turned off (like 'G40').
. The spindle is stopped (like 'M5').
. The current motion mode is set to feed (like 'G1').
. Coolant is turned off (like 'M9').

[NOTE]
Lines of code after M2/M30 will not be executed.
Pressing cycle start will start the program
at the beginning of the file.

== M60 Program Pause[[sec:M60]]
(((M60 Program Pause)))

* 'M60' - exchange pallet shuttles and then pause a running program
          temporarily (regardless of the setting of the optional stop
          switch). Pressing the cycle start button
          will restart the program at the following line.

== M3, M4, M5 Spindle Control[[sec:M3-M4-M5]]
(((M3 Spindle CW)))(((M4 Spindle CCW)))(((M5 Spindle Stop)))

* 'M3' - start the spindle clockwise at the 'S' speed.
* 'M4' - start the spindle counterclockwise at the 'S' speed.
* 'M5' - stop the spindle.

It is OK to use 'M3' or 'M4' if the <<sec:S-spindle-speed,S>>
spindle speed is set to zero. If this is done
(or if the speed override switch is enabled and set to zero),
the spindle will not start turning.
If, later, the spindle speed is set above zero
(or the override switch is turned up),
the spindle will start turning.
It is OK to use 'M3' or 'M4' when the spindle is already
turning or to use 'M5' when the spindle is already stopped.

== M6 Tool Change[[sec:M6-Tool-Change]]

(((M6-Tool-Change)))

=== Manual Tool Change

If the HAL component hal_manualtoolchange is loaded,
M6 will stop the spindle and prompt the user to change the tool
based on the last 'T-' number programmed.
For more information on hal_manualtoolchange see
the (<<sec:Manual-Tool-Change,Manual Tool Change>>) Section.

=== Tool Changer

To change a tool in the spindle from the tool currently in the spindle
to the tool most recently selected (using a T word - see Section
<<sec:T-Select-Tool,Select Tool>>), program 'M6'.
When the tool change is complete:

* The spindle will be stopped. 
* The tool that was selected (by a T word on the same line or on any
   line after the previous tool change) will be in the spindle.
   The T number is an integer giving the
   changer slot of the tool (not its id).
* If the selected tool was not in the spindle before the tool change,
   the tool that was in the spindle
   (if there was one)
   will be in its changer slot.
* If configured in the .ini file some axis positions may move when a M6
   is issued. See the EMCIO section of the Integrator's Manual for more
   information on tool change options.
* No other changes will be made. For example, coolant will continue to
   flow during the tool change unless it has been turned off by an 'M9'.

[WARNING]
The tool length offset is not changed by 'M6', use 'G43' after the
'M6' to change the tool length offset.

The tool change may include axis motion. 
It is OK (but not useful) to program a change to the tool already in the spindle.
It is OK if there is no tool in the selected slot;
in that case, the spindle will be empty after the tool change.
If slot zero was last selected,
there will definitely be no tool in the spindle after a tool change. The tool
changer will have to be setup to perform the tool change in hal and possibly
classicladder.

== M7, M8, M9 Coolant Control[[sec:M7-M8-M9]]
(((M7 Mist Coolant)))(((M8 Flood Coolant)))(((M9 Coolant Off)))

* 'M7' - turn mist coolant on.
* 'M8' - turn flood coolant on.
* 'M9' - turn all coolant off.

It is OK to use any of these commands, regardless of the current coolant
state.

== M48, M49 Override Control[[sec:M48-M49-Override]]
(((M48, M49 Override Control)))

* 'M48' - enable the spindle speed and feed rate override controls.
* 'M49' - disable both controls.

It is OK to enable or disable the controls when 
they are already enabled or disabled. 
See the <<sec:Feed-Interaction,Feed Interaction>> Section for more details.

== M50 Feed Override Control[[sec:M50-Feed-Override]]
(((M50 Feed Override Control)))

* 'M50 <P1>' - enable the feed rate override control. The P1
               is optional. 
* 'M50 P0' - disable the feed rate control.
 
While disabled the feed override will have no influence,
and the motion will be executed at programmed feed rate.
(unless there is an adaptive feed rate override active).

== M51 Spindle Speed Override Control[[sec:M51-Spindle-Override]]
(((M51 Spindle Speed Override)))

* 'M51 <P1>' - enable the spindle speed override control. The P1
               is optional. 
* 'M51 P0' - disable the spindle speed override control program.
             While disabled the spindle speed override will have
             no influence, and the spindle speed will have the
             exact program specified value of the S-word
             (described in <<sec:S-Set-Spindle,Spindle Speed>> Section).

== M52 Adaptive Feed Control[[sec:M52-Adaptive-Feed-Control]]
(((M52 Adaptive Feed Control)))

* 'M52 <P1>' - use an adaptive feed. The P1 is optional.
* 'M52 P0' - stop using adaptive feed.
 
When adaptive feed is enabled, some external input value is used together
with the user interface feed override value and the commanded feed rate
to set the actual feed rate. In LinuxCNC, the HAL pin 'motion.adaptive-feed'
is used for this purpose. Values on 'motion.adaptive-feed' should range
from 0 (feed hold) to 1 (full speed).

== M53 Feed Stop Control[[sec:M53-Feed-Stop-Control]]
(((M53 Feed Stop Control)))

* 'M53 <P1>' - enable the feed stop switch. The P1 is optional.
               Enabling the feed stop switch will allow motion to be
               interrupted by means of the feed stop control. In LinuxCNC,
               the HAL pin 'motion.feed-hold' is used for this purpose. A 'true'
               value will cause the motion to stop when 'M53' is active.

* 'M53 P0' - disable the feed stop switch. The state of 'motion.feed-hold'
             will have no effect on feed when M53 is not active.


== M61 Set Current Tool Number[[sec:M61-Set-Current-Tool-Number]]
(((M61 Set Current Tool Number)))

* 'M61 Q-' - change the current tool number while in MDI or Manual mode.
             One use is when you power up LinuxCNC with a tool currently in
             the spindle you can set that tool number without doing a tool change.

It is an error if:

* Q- is not 0 or greater

== M62 to M65 Output Control[[sec:M62-M65]]
(((M62 to M65 Output Control)))

* 'M62 P-' - turn on digital output synchronized with motion.
             The P- word specifies the digital output number.

* 'M63 P-' - turn off digital output synchronized with motion.
             The P- word specifies the digital output number.

* 'M64 P-' - turn on digital output immediately.
             The P- word specifies the digital output number.

* 'M65 P-' - turn off digital output immediately.
             The P- word specifies the digital output number.

The P-word ranges from 0 to a default value of 3. If needed the the
number of I/O can be increased by using the num_dio parameter when loading
the motion controller. See the Integrator's Manual Configuration Section LinuxCNC and
HAL section for more information.

The M62 & M63 commands will be queued. Subsequent commands referring
to the same output number will overwrite the older settings. More than
one output change can be specified by issuing more than one M62/M63
command.

The actual change of the specified outputs will happen at the
beginning of the next motion command. If there is no subsequent motion
command, the queued output changes won't happen. It's best to always
program a motion g-code (G0, G1, etc) right after the M62/63.

M64 & M65 happen immediately as they are received by the motion
controller. They are not synchronized with movement, and they will
break blending.

== M66 Wait on Input[[sec:M66-Input-Control]]
(((M66 Input Control)))

----
M66 P- | E- <L->
----
* 'P-' - specifies the digital input number from 0 to 3.
* 'E-' - specifies the analog input number from 0 to 3.
* 'L-' - specifies the wait mode type.
**   'Mode 0: IMMEDIATE' - no waiting, returns immediately.
       The current value of the input is stored in parameter #5399
**   'Mode 1: RISE' - waits for the selected input to perform a rise event.
**   'Mode 2: FALL' - waits for the selected input to perform a fall event.
**   'Mode 3: HIGH' - waits for the selected input to go to the HIGH state.
**   'Mode 4: LOW' - waits for the selected input to go to the LOW state.
* 'Q-' - specifies the timeout in seconds for waiting. If the timeout is
         exceeded, the wait is interrupt, and the variable #5399 will be holding
         the value -1. The Q value is ignored if the L-word is zero (IMMEDIATE).
         A Q value of zero is an error if the L-word is non-zero.

* Mode 0 is the only one permitted for an analog input.

.M66 Example Lines
----
M66 P0 L3 (wait for digital input 0 to turn on)
M66 E1 L1 (wait for analog input 1 to rise)
----

M66 wait on an input stops further execution of the program, until the
selected event (or the programmed timeout) occurs.

It is an error to program M66 with both a P-word and an E-word (thus
selecting both an analog and a digital input).In LinuxCNC these inputs are
not monitored in real time and thus should not be used for
timing-critical applications.

The number of I/O can be increased
by using the num_dio or num_aio parameter when
loading the motion controller. See the Integrator's
Manual, Configuration Section, LinuxCNC and HAL subsection, for more
information. 

== M67 Synchronized Analog Output[[sec:M67-Analog-Output]]
(((M67 Analog Motion Output Control)))

----
M67 E- Q-
----
* 'M67' - set an analog output synchronized with motion.
* 'E-' - output number ranging from 0 to 3.
* 'Q-' - is the value to set (set to 0 to turn off).

The actual change of the specified outputs will happen at the
beginning of the next motion command. If there is no subsequent motion
command, the queued output changes won't happen. It's best to always
program a motion g-code (G0, G1, etc) right after the M67. M67 functions
the same as M62-63.

The number of I/O can be increased by
using the num_aio parameter when loading the motion controller. See the
'LinuxCNC and HAL' chapter in the Configuration Section of the Integrator
Manual for more information on the Motion Controller.

== M68 Analog Output[[sec:M68-Analog-Output]]
(((M68 Analog Aux Output Control)))

----
M68 E- Q-
----
* 'M68' - set an analog output immediately.
* 'E-' - output number ranging from 0 to 3.
* 'Q-' - is the value to set (set to 0 to turn off).

M68 output happen immediately as they are received by the motion
controller. They are not synchronized with movement, and they will
break blending. M68 functions the same as M64-65.

The number of I/O can be increased by using the
num_aio parameter when loading the motion controller. See the 'LinuxCNC and
HAL' chapter in the Configuration Section of the Integrator's Manual for
more information on the Motion Controller. 

== M100 to M199 User Defined Commands[[sec:M100-to-M199]]
(((M100 to M199 User Defined Commands)))(((User Defined Commands M100-M199)))

----
M1-- <P- Q->
----

* 'M1--' - an integer in the range of 100 - 199.
* 'P-' - a number passed to the file as the first parameter.
* 'Q-' - a number passed to the file as the second parameter.

The external program 'M1nn'
must be in the directory named in [DISPLAY] PROGRAM_PREFIX in the ini
file and is executed with the P and Q values as its two arguments.
Execution of the RS274NGC file pauses until the invoked program exits.
Any valid executable file can be used.

The error 'Unknown M code used' denotes one of the following

* The specified User Defined Command does not exist
* The file is not an executable file

For example to open and close a collet closer that is controlled by a
parport pin using a bash script file using M101 and M102. Create two
files named M101 and M102. Set them as executable files (typically
right click/properties/permissions) before running LinuxCNC. Make sure the
parport pin is not connected to anything in a HAL file.

.M101 Example File
----
#!/bin/sh
# file to turn on parport pin 14 to open the collet closer
halcmd setp parport.0.pin-14-out True
exit 0
----

.M102 Example File
----
#!/bin/sh
# file to turn off parport pin 14 to open the collet closer
halcmd setp parport.0.pin-14-out False
exit 0
----

To pass a variable to a M1nn file you use the P and Q option like this:

----
M100 P123.456 Q321.654
----

.M100 Example file
----
#!/bin/sh
voltage=$1
feedrate=$2
halcmd setp thc.voltage $voltage
halcmd setp thc.feedrate $feedrate
exit 0
----

To display a graphic message and stop until the message window is closed
use a graphic display program like Eye of Gnome to display the graphic
file. When you close it the program will resume.
