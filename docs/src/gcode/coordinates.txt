= Coordinate Systems

[[cha:coordinate-system]] (((Coordinate System)))

== Introduction

This chapter introduces you to offsets as they are used by the LinuxCNC.
These include:

* Machine Coordinates (G53)
* Nine Coordinate System Offsets (G54-G59.3)
* Global Offsets (G92) and Local Offsets (G52)

== Machine Coordinate System

Regardless of any offsets that may be in effect, putting a G53 in a block of
code tells the interpreter to go to the real or absolute axis positions
commanded in the block and ignore any offsets in effect. In the following
example the machine will move to the machine coordinates set when the axes
were homed and will ignore any coordianate system and global offsets in effect.

----
G53 G0 X0 Y0 Z0

G53 is not a modal command. It must be used on each line where motion
based upon absolute machine position is desired.

.Coordinate System Offsets

* G54 - use coordinate system 1
* G55 - use coordinate system 2
* G56 - use coordinate system 3
* G57 - use coordinate system 4
* G58 - use coordinate system 5
* G59 - use coordinate system 6
* G59.1 - use coordinate system 7
* G59.2 - use coordinate system 8
* G59.3 - use coordinate system 9

Coordinate system offsets are used to shift the coordinate system from the
machine coordinate system. This allows the G code to be programmed for the
part without regard to the part location on the machine. Using coordinate
system offsets would allow you to machine parts in multiple locations with the
same G code.

The values for offsets are stored in the VAR file that is requested by the INI
file during the startup of an LinuxCNC.

In the VAR file scheme, the first variable number stores the X offset,
the second the Y offset and so on for all six axes. There are numbered
sets like this for each of the coordinate system offsets.

Each of the graphical interfaces has a way to set values for these
offsets.  You can also set these values by editing the VAR file itself
and then restart LinuxCNC so that the LinuxCNC reads the new values
however this is not the recommended way. Using G10, G52, G92, G28.1,
etc are better ways to set the variables.

.Example of G55 parameters
[width="40%",cols="^,^,^",options="header"]
|====
|Axis | Variable | Value
| X |5241 |2.000000
| Y |5242 |1.000000
| Z |5243 |-2.000000
| A |5244 |0.000000
| B |5245 |0.000000
| C |5246 |0.000000
| U |5247 |0.000000
| V |5248 |0.000000
| W |5249 |0.000000
|====

You should read this as moving the zero positions of G55 to X = 2
units, Y= 1 unit, and Z = -2 units away from the absolute zero position.

Once there are values assigned, a call to G55 in a program block would
shift the zero reference by the values stored. The following line would
then move each axis to the new zero position. Unlike G53, G54 through
G59.3 are modal commands. They will act on all blocks of code after one
of them has been set. The program that might be run using
fixture offsets would require only a single coordinate
reference for each of the locations and all of the work to be done
there. The following code is offered as an example of making a square
using the G55 offsets that we set above.

----
G55 ; use coordinate system 2
G0 X0 Y0 Z0
G1 F2 Z-0.2000
X1
Y1
X0
Y0
G0 Z0
G54 ; use coordinate system 1
G0 X0 Y0 Z0
M2
----

In this example the G54 near the end leaves the G54 coordinate system with all
zero offsets so that there is a modal code for the absolute machine based axis
positions. This program assumes that we have done that and use the ending
command as a command to machine zero. It would have been possible to use G53
and arrive at the same place but that command would not have been modal and
any commands issued after it would have returned to using the G55 offsets
because that coordinate system would still be in effect.

=== Default Coordinate System

One other variable in the VAR file becomes important when we think
about offset systems. This variable is named 5220. In the default files
its value is set to 1.00000. This means that when the LinuxCNC starts up it
should use the first coordinate system as its default. If you set this
to 9.00000 it would use the ninth offset system as its default for
start up and reset. Any value other than an integer (decimal really)
between 1 and 9, or a missing 5220 variable will cause the LinuxCNC to
revert to the default value of 1.00000 on start up.

=== Setting Coordinate System Offsets

The G10 L2x command can be used to set coordinate system offsets:

* 'G10 L2  P(1-9)' - Set offset(s) to a value. Current position irrelevant.
                         (see <<gcode:g10-l2,G10 L2>> for details)

* 'G10 L20 P(1-9)' - Set offset(s) so current position becomes a value.
                         (see <<gcode:g10-l20,G10 L20>> for details)

== Local and Global Offsets[[sec:g52-and-g92-offsets]]

=== The G52 command[[sec:g52]]

'G52' is used in a part program as a temporary "local coordinate
system offset" within the workpiece coordinate system.  An example use
case is when machining several identical features at different
locations on a part.  For each feature, 'G52' programs a local
reference point within workpiece coordinates, and a subprogram is
called to machine the feature relative to that point.

'G52' axis offsets are programmed relative to workpiece coordinate
offsets 'G54' through 'G59.3'.  As a local offset, 'G52' is applied
after the workpiece offset, including rotation.  Thus, a part feature
will be machined identically on each part regardless of the part's
orientation on the pallet.

[CAUTION]

As a temporary offset, set and unset within the localized scope of a
part program, in other g-code interpreters 'G52' does not persist
after machine reset, 'M02' or 'M30'.  In LinuxCNC, 'G52' shares
parameters with 'G92', which, for historical reasons, *does* persist
these parameters.  See <<sec:g92-persistence-cautions,G92 Persistenc
Cautions>> below.

[CAUTION]

'G52' and 'G92' share the same offset registers.  Therefore, setting
'G52' will override any earlier 'G92' setting, and 'G52' will persist
across machine reset when 'G92' persistence is enabled.  These
interactions may result in unexpected offsets.  See
<<sec:g92-g52-interaction-cautions,G92 and G52 Interaction Cautions>>
below.

Programming 'G52 X1 Y2' offsets the current workpiece coordinate
system X axis by 1 and Y axis by 2.  Accordingly, on the DRO, the
current tool position's X and Y coordinates will be reduced by 1 and
2, respectively.  Axes unset in the command, such as Z in the previous
example, will be unaffected: any previous 'G52' Z offset will remain
in effect, and otherwise the Z offset will be zero.

The temporary local offset may be canceled with 'G52 X0 Y0'.  Any axes
not explicitly zeroed will retain the previous offset.

'G52' shares the same offset registers as the legacy 'G92', and thus
'G52' is visible on the DRO and preview labeled with 'G92'.

=== The G92 commands[[sec:g92-commands]]

'G92' is typically used in two conceptually different ways: as a
"global coordinate system offset" or as a "local coordinate system
offset".  The 'G92' set of commands includes:

* 'G92' - This command, when used with axis names, sets values to offset
    variables.

* 'G92.1' - This command sets zero values to the G92 variables.

* 'G92.2' - This command suspends but does not zero out the G92
    variables.

* 'G92.3' - This command applies offset values that have been suspended.

As a global offset, 'G92' is used to shift all workpiece coordinate
systems 'G54' through 'G59.3'.  An example use case is when machining
several identical parts in fixtures with known locations on a pallet,
but the pallet location may change between runs or between machines.
Each fixture location offset, relative to a reference point on the
pallet, is preset in one of the workpiece coordinate systems, 'G54'
through 'G59.3', and 'G92' is used to "touch off" on the pallet
reference point.  Then, for each part, the corresponding workpiece
coordinate system is selected and the part program is executed.

[NOTE]
'G10 R-' workpiece coordinate system rotation is specific to the
'rs274ngc' interpreter, and the 'G92' offset is applied 'after'
rotation.  When using 'G92' as a global offset, workpiece coordinate
system rotations may have unexpected results.

As a local coordinate system, 'G92' is used as a temporary offset
within the workpiece coordinate system.  An example use case is when
machining a part with several identical features at different
locations.  For each feature, 'G92' is used to set a local reference
point, and a subprogram is called to machine the feature starting at
that point.

[NOTE]
The use of 'G92' is discouraged for programming with local coordinate
systems in a part program.  Instead, see <<sec:g52,'G52'>>, a local
coordinate system offset more intuitive when desired offset relative
to the workpiece is known but current tool location may not be known.

Programming 'G92 X0 Y0 Z0' sets the current tool location to the
coordinates X0, Y0, and Z0, without motion.  G92 *does not* work from
absolute machine coordinates.  It works from *current location*.

'G92' also works from current location as modified by any other
offsets that are in effect when the 'G92' command is invoked. While
testing for differences between work offsets and actual offsets it was
found that a 'G54' offset could cancel out a 'G92' and thus give the
appearance that no offsets were in effect. However, the 'G92' was
still in effect for all coordinates and did produce expected work
offsets for the other coordinate systems.

By default, 'G92' offsets are cleared after the machine is started and
after a 'M02' or 'M30'.  Programmers that often use 'G92' as a global
offset and do not use 'G92' or 'G52' for local coordinate systems may
wish for the offset to persist between machine resets.  Enable 'G92'
persistence by setting 'PERSISTENT_G92_OFFSET = true' in the
'[RS274NGC]' section of the '.ini' file.

[NOTE]

Especially when enabling 'G92' offset persistence, it is good practice
to clear the 'G92' offsets at the end of their use with 'G92.1' or
'G92.2'. When starting up LinuxCNC with 'G92' persistence enabled, any
offsets in the 'G92' variables will be applied when an axis is homed.
See <<sec:g92-persistence-cautions,G92 Persistence Cautions>> below.

=== Setting G92 Values

G92 commands work from current axis location and add and subtract
correctly to give the current axis position the value assigned by the
G92 command. The effects work even though previous offsets are in.

So if the X axis is currently showing 2.0000 as its position a 'G92 X0'
will set an offset of -2.0000 so that the current location of X becomes
zero. A 'G92 X2' will set an offset of 0.0000 and the displayed position
will not change. A 'G92 X5.0000' will set an offset of 3.0000 so that the
current displayed position becomes 5.0000.

=== G92 Persistence Cautions[[sec:g92-persistence-cautions]]

By default, the values of a 'G92' offset will remain in the VAR file.
This may happen unintentionally when a program is aborted while 'G92'
offsets are in effect.  In this case, the saved 'G92' offsets will be
restored after a machine reset or startup.

The G92 parameters are:

* 5210 - Enable/disable flag (1.0/0.0)
* 5211 - X Axis Offset
* 5212 - Y Axis Offset
* 5213 - Z Axis Offset
* 5214 - A Axis Offset
* 5215 - B Axis Offset
* 5216 - C Axis Offset
* 5217 - U Axis Offset
* 5218 - V Axis Offset
* 5219 - W Axis Offset

where 5210 is the 'G92' enable flag (1 for enabled, 0 for disabled)
and 5211 are the axis offsets. If you are seeing unexpected positions
as the result of a commanded move, as a result of storing an offset in
a previous program and not clearing them at the end then issue a G92.1
in the MDI window to clear the stored offsets.

If G92 values exist in the VAR file when LinuxCNC starts up, the G92
values in the var file will be applied to the values of the current
location of each axis. If this is home position and home position is
set as machine zero everything will be correct. Once home has been
established using real machine switches, or by moving each axis to a known
home position and issuing an axis home command, any G92 offsets will be
applied. If you have a G92 X1 in effect when you home the X axis the
DRO will read 'X: 1.000' instead of the expected 'X: 0.000' because the
G92 was applied to the machine origin. If you issue a G92.1 and the DRO
now reads all zeros then you had a G92 offset in effect when you last
ran LinuxCNC.

When 'G92' offset persistence is enabled, unless your intention is to
use the same G92 offsets in the next program, the best practice is to
issue a G92.1 at the end of any G Code files where you use G92
offsets.

When a file is aborted during processing that has 'G92' offsets in
effect a startup will cause them to become active again.  As a
safeguard, always have your preamble to set the environment as you
expect it.  Additionally, 'G92' persistence may be disabled by setting
'PERSISTENT_G92_OFFSET = false' in the '[RS274NGC]' section of the
'.ini' file.

=== G92 and G52 Interaction Cautions[[sec:g92-g52-interaction-cautions]]

'G52' and 'G92' share the same offset registers.  When 'G92'
persistence is enabled in the '.ini' file (see <<sec:g92-commands,G92
Commands>>), 'G52' offsets will also persist after machine reset,
'M02' or 'M30'.  When 'G92' persistence is enabled, beware that a
'G52' offset in effect during a program abort may result in unintended
offsets when the next program is run.  See <<sec:g92-persistence-cautions,G92
Persistence Cautions>> above.

== Sample Programs Using Offsets

=== Sample Program Using Workpiece Coordinate Offsets

This sample engraving project mills a set of four .1 radius circles in
roughly a star shape around a center circle. We can setup the
individual circle pattern like this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
G10 L2 P1 X0 Y0 Z0 (ensure that G54 is set to machine zero)
G0 X-0.1 Y0 Z0
G1 F1 Z-0.25
G3 X-0.1 Y0 I0.1 J0
G0 Z0
M2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We can issue a set of commands to create offsets for the four other
circles like this.

-----------------------------------------------------------
G10 L2 P2 X0.5 (offsets G55 X value by 0.5 inch)
G10 L2 P3 X-0.5 (offsets G56 X value by -0.5 inch)
G10 L2 P4 Y0.5 (offsets G57 Y value by 0.5 inch)
G10 L2 P5 Y-0.5 (offsets G58 Y value by -0.5 inch)
-----------------------------------------------------------

We put these together in the following program:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(a program for milling five small circles in a diamond shape)

G10 L2 P1 X0 Y0 Z0 (ensure that G54 is machine zero)
G10 L2 P2 X0.5 (offsets G55 X value by 0.5 inch)
G10 L2 P3 X-0.5 (offsets G56 X value by -0.5 inch)
G10 L2 P4 Y0.5 (offsets G57 Y value by 0.5 inch)
G10 L2 P5 Y-0.5 (offsets G58 Y value by -0.5 inch)

G54 G0 X-0.1 Y0 Z0 (center circle)
G1 F1 Z-0.25
G3 X-0.1 Y0 I0.1 J0
G0 Z0

G55 G0 X-0.1 Y0 Z0 (first offset circle)
G1 F1 Z-0.25
G3 X-0.1 Y0 I0.1 J0
G0 Z0

G56 G0 X-0.1 Y0 Z0 (second offset circle)
G1 F1 Z-0.25
G3 X-0.1 Y0 I0.1 J0
G0 Z0

G57 G0 X-0.1 Y0 Z0 (third offset circle)
G1 F1 Z-0.25
G3 X-0.1 Y0 I0.1 J0
G0 Z0

G58 G0 X-0.1 Y0 Z0 (fourth offset circle)
G1 F1 Z-0.25
G3 X-0.1 Y0 I0.1 J0
G54 G0 X0 Y0 Z0

M2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now comes the time when we might apply a set of G92 offsets to this
program. You'll see that it is running in each case at Z0. If the mill
were at the zero position, a G92 Z1.0000 issued at the head of the
program would shift everything an inch. You might also shift the
whole pattern around in the XY plane by adding some X and Y offsets
with G92. If you do this you should add a G92.1 command just before the
M2 that ends the program. If you do not, other programs that you might
run after this one will also use that G92 offset. Furthermore it would
save the G92 values when you shut down the LinuxCNC and they will be
recalled when you start up again.
