== Conventions

Conventions used in this section

In the G-code prototypes the hyphen ('-') stands for a real value
and ('<>') denotes an optional item.

If 'L-' is written in a prototype the '-' will often be referred to
as the 'L number', and so on for any other letter.

In the G-code prototypes the word 'axes' stands for any axis as defined
in your configuration.

An optional value will be written like this '<L- >'.

A real value may be:

* An explicit number, '4'
* An expression, '[2+2]'
* A parameter value, '#88'
* A unary function value, 'acos[0]'

In most cases, if 'axis' words are given
(any or all of 'X Y Z A B C U V W'),
they specify a destination point.

Axis numbers are in the currently active coordinate system,
unless explicitly described as being
in the absolute coordinate system.

Where axis words are optional, any omitted axes will retain their
original value.

Any items in the G-code prototypes not explicitly described as
optional are required.

The values following letters are often given as explicit numbers.
Unless stated otherwise, the explicit numbers can be real values. For
example, 'G10 L2' could equally well be written 'G[2*5] L[1+1]'. If the
value of parameter 100 were 2, 'G10 L#100' would also mean the same.

If 'L-' is written in a prototype the '-' will often be referred to
as the 'L number', and so on for any other letter.

----
G0 <axes>
----

For rapid motion, program 'G0 axes', where all the axis words are
optional. The 'G0' is optional if the current motion mode is 'G0'. This
will produce coordinated motion to the destination point at the maximum
rapid rate (or slower). 'G0' is typically used as a positioning move.

=== Rapid Velocity Rate

The MAX_VELOCITY setting in the INI file [TRAJ] section defines the
maximumrapid traverse rate. The maximum rapid traverse rate can be
higher than the individual axes MAX_VELOCITY setting during a
coordinated move. The maximum rapid traverse rate can be slower than the
MAX_VELOCITY setting in the [TRAJ] section if an axis MAX_VELOCITY or
trajectory constraints limit it.

section.

If 'G53' is programmed on the same line, the motion will also differ;

The path of a G0 rapid motion can be rounded at direction changes and
depends on the <<sec:trajectory-control,trajectory control>> settings
and maximum acceleration of the axes.

////
FIXME Is "full turn optimisation" actually available ?
If a 'G0' movement only moves rotary axes and the target position for
these axes is in an interval of -360 to 360 degrees, the movement will
be organized so that each rotary axis makes less than one full turn.

== G2, G3 Arc Move(((G2, G3 Arc Move)))

[source,{ngc}]
----
G2 or G3 axes offsets (center format)
G2 or G3 axes R- (radius format)
G2 or G3 offsets|R- <P-> (full circles)
----

A circular or helical arc is specified using either 'G2' (clockwise
arc) or 'G3' (counterclockwise arc) at the current
<<sec:set-feed-rate,feed rate>>. The direction (CW, CCW) is as viewed
from the positive end of the axis about which the circular motion occurs.

The axis of the circle or helix must be parallel to the X, Y, or Z axis
of the machine coordinate system.
The axis (or, equivalently, the plane perpendicular to the axis) is
selected with 'G17' (Z-axis, XY-plane), 'G18' (Y-axis, XZ-plane), or
'G19' (X-axis, YZ-plane).
Planes '17.1', '18.1', and '19.1' are not currently supported.
If the arc is circular, it lies in a plane parallel to the selected
plane.

To program a helix, include the axis word perpendicular to the arc
plane, for example, if in the 'G17' plane, include a 'Z' word. This
will cause the 'Z' axis to move to the programmed value during the
circular 'XY' motion.

To program an arc that gives more than one full turn, use the 'P' word
specifying the number of full turns plus the programmed arc. The 'P'
word must be an integer. If 'P' is unspecified, the behavior is as if
'P1' was given that is, only one full or partial turn will result. For
example, if a 180 degree arc is programmed with a P2, the resulting
motion will be 1 1/2 rotations. For each P increment above 1 an extra
full circle is added to the programmed arc. Multi turn helical arcs are
supported and give motion useful for milling holes or threads.

WARNING: If the pitch of the helix is very small (less than the
<<sub:programming-the-planner,naive CAM tolerance>>) then
the helix might be converted into a straight line.
https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/issues/222[Bug #222]

If a line of code makes an arc and includes rotary axis motion,
the rotary axes turn at a constant rate so that the rotary
motion starts and finishes when the XYZ motion starts and finishes.
Lines of this sort are hardly ever programmed.

If cutter compensation is active, the motion will differ from
the above; see the <<sec:cutter-radius-compensation,Cutter Compensation>>
section.

The arc center is absolute or relative as set by
<<gcode:g90.1-g91.1,G90.1 or G91.1>> respectively.

Two formats are allowed for specifying an arc: Center Format and Radius
Format.

It is an error if:

* No feed rate has been set.
* The P word is not an integer.

=== Center Format Arcs

Center format arcs are more accurate than radius format arcs and are
the preferred format to use.

The end point of the arc along with the offset to the center of the
arc from the current location are used to program arcs that are less
than a full circle. It is OK if the end point of the arc is the same
as the current location.

The offset to the center of the arc from the current location and
optionally the number of turns are used to program full circles.

When programming arcs an error due to rounding can result from using a
precision of less than 4 decimal places (0.0000) for inch and less than
3 decimal places (0.000) for millimeters.

.Incremental Arc Distance Mode
Arc center offsets are a relative distance from the start location of
the arc.
Incremental Arc Distance Mode is default.

One or more axis words and one or more offsets must be programmed for an
arc that is less than 360 degrees.

No axis words and one or more offsets must be programmed for full circles.
The 'P' word defaults to 1 and is optional.

For more information on 'Incremental Arc Distance Mode see the
<<gcode:g90.1-g91.1,G91.1>> section.

.Absolute Arc Distance Mode
Arc center offsets are the absolute distance from the current 0 position
of the axis.

One or more axis words and 'both' offsets must be programmed for arcs
less than 360 degrees.

No axis words and both offsets must be programmed for full circles.
The 'P' word defaults to 1 and is optional.

For more information on 'Absolute Arc Distance Mode see the
<<gcode:g90.1-g91.1,G90.1>> section.

  the current point to the center differs from the distance from the end

* 'center' - the center position as calculated using the i, j, or k words
* 'end' - the programmed end point
* 'r1' - radius from the start position to the center
* 'r2' - radius from the end position to the center

=== Center Format Examples

Calculating arcs by hand can be difficult at times. One option is to
draw the arc with a CAD program to get the coordinates and offsets.
Keep in mind the tolerance mentioned above, you may have to change the
precision of your CAD program to get the desired results. Another
option is to calculate the coordinates and offset using formulas. As
you can see in the following figures a triangle can be formed from the
current position the end position and the arc center.

In the following figure you can see the start position is X0 Y0, the
end position is X1 Y1. The arc center position is at X1 Y0. This gives
us an offset from the start position of 1 in the X axis and 0 in the Y
axis. In this case only an I offset is needed.

we are doing a G2 or a G3 move. For the G2 move the start position is
X0 Y0, for the G3 move it is X0 Y1. The arc center is at X1 Y0.5 for
both moves. The G2 move the J offset is 0.5 and the G3 move the J

=== Radius Format Arcs

[source,{ngc}]
----
G2 or G3 axes R- <P->
----

* 'R' - radius from current position

It is not good practice to program radius format arcs that are nearly
full circles or nearly semicircles because a small change in the
location of the end point will produce a much larger change in the
location of the center of the circle (and, hence, the middle of the
arc). The magnification effect is large enough that rounding error in a
number can produce out-of-tolerance cuts. For instance, a 1%
displacement of the endpoint of a 180 degree arc produced a 7%
displacement of the point 90 degrees along the arc. Nearly full circles
are even worse. Other size arcs (in the range tiny to 165 degrees or
195 to 345 degrees) are OK.

In the radius format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in
the selected plane are specified along with the radius of the arc.
Program 'G2' 'axes' 'R-' (or use 'G3' instead of 'G2' ). R is the
radius. The axis words are all optional except that at
least one of the two words for the axes in the selected plane must be
used. The R number is the radius. A positive radius indicates that the
arc turns through less than 180 degrees, while a negative radius
indicates a turn of more than 180 degrees. If the arc is helical, the
value of the end point of the arc on the coordinate axis parallel to
the axis of the helix is also specified.

It is an error if:

* both of the axis words for the axes of the selected plane are omitted
* the end point of the arc is the same as the current point.

of Z is 5, this is an arc of a circle parallel to the XY-plane;
otherwise it is a helical arc.

G5 creates a cubic B-spline in the XY plane with the X and Y axes only.
P and Q must both be specified for every G5 command.

For the first G5 command in a series of G5 commands, I and J must both
be specified.  For subsequent G5 commands, either both I and J must be
specified, or neither.  If I and J are unspecified, the starting
direction of this cubic will automatically match the ending direction of
the previous cubic (as if I and J are the negation of the previous P and
Q).

Program G7 to enter the diameter mode for axis X on a lathe. When in
the diameter mode the X axis moves on a lathe will be 1/2 the distance
to the center of the lathe. For example X1 would move the cutter to
0.500" from the center of the lathe thus giving a 1" diameter part.

Important Concepts:

* `G10 L2 Pn` does not change from the current coordinate system to the
  one specified by P, you have to use G54-59.3 to select a coordinate
  system.
* When a rotation is in effect jogging an axis will only move that axis
  in a positive or negative direction and not along the rotated axis.
* If a 'G52' local offset or 'G92' origin offset was in effect before
  'G10 L2', it will continue to be in effect afterwards.
* When programming a coordinate system with R, any 'G52' or 'G92' will
  be applied *after* the rotation.
* The coordinate system whose origin is set by a 'G10' command may be
  active or inactive at the time the 'G10' is executed.
  If it is currently active, the new coordinates take effect immediately.

It is an error if:

* The P number does not evaluate to an integer in the range 0 to 9.
* An axis is programmed that is not defined in the configuration.

----

* 'K' - distance per revolution

For spindle-synchronized motion in one direction, code 'G33 X- Y- Z- K-'
where K gives the distance moved in XYZ for each revolution of the
spindle.
For instance, if starting at 'Z=0', 'G33 Z-1 K.0625' produces a 1 inch
motion in Z over 16 revolutions of the spindle.
This command might be part of a program to produce a 16TPI thread.
Another example in metric, 'G33 Z-15 K1.5' produces a movement of 15mm
while the spindle rotates 10 times for a thread of 1.5mm.

The (optional) $ argument sets which spindle the motion is synchronised
to (default is zero). For example G33 Z10 K1 $1 will move the spindle in
synchrony with the spindle.N.revs HAL pin value.

Spindle-synchronized motion waits for the spindle index and spindle at
speed pins, so multiple passes line up. 'G33' moves end at the programmed
endpoint.
G33 could be used to cut tapered threads or a fusee.

All the axis words are optional, except that at least one must be used.

[NOTE]
K follows the drive line described by 'X- Y- Z-'. K is not parallel to
the Z axis if X or Y endpoints are used for example when cutting tapered
threads.

[[gcode:g33-tech-info]]
.Technical Info
At the beginning of each G33 pass, LinuxCNC uses the spindle speed and
the machine acceleration limits to calculate how long it will take Z to
accelerate after the index pulse, and determines how many degrees the
spindle will rotate during that time. It then adds that angle to the
index position and computes the Z position using the corrected spindle
angle. That means that Z will reach the correct position just as it
finishes accelerating to the proper speed, and can immediately begin
cutting a good thread.

.HAL Connections
The pin 'spindle.N.at-speed' must be set or driven true for the motion to
start. Additionally spindle.N.revs must increase by 1 for each revolution
of the spindle and the spindle.N.index-enable pin must be connected to
an encoder (or resolver) counter which resets index-enable once per rev.

See the Integrators Manual for more information on spindle synchronized
motion.

[WARNING]
For Z only tapping preposition the XY location prior to calling G33.1
and only use a Z word in the G33.1. If the coordinates specified are not
the current coordinates when calling G33.1 for tapping the move will not
be along the Z axis but will be a coordinated, spindle-synchronized move
from the current location to the location specified and back.

For rigid tapping (spindle synchronized motion with return), code
'G33.1 X- Y- Z- K-' where 'K-' gives the distance moved for each
revolution of the spindle.

A rigid tapping move consists of the following sequence:

* A move from the current coordinate to the specified coordinate,
  synchronized with the selected spindle at the given ratio and starting
  from the current coordinate with a spindle index pulse.
* When reaching the endpoint, a command to reverse the spindle, and
  speed up by a factor set by the multiplier (e.g., from clockwise to
  counterclockwise).
* Continued synchronized motion beyond the specified end coordinate
  until the spindle actually stops and reverses.
* Continued synchronized motion back to the original coordinate.
* When reaching the original coordinate,
  a command to reverse the spindle a second time
  (e.g., from counterclockwise to clockwise).
* Continued synchronized motion beyond the original coordinate
  until the spindle actually stops and reverses.
* An *unsynchronized* move back to the original coordinate.

Spindle-synchronized motions wait for spindle index,
so multiple passes line up.'G33.1' moves end at the original coordinate.

[IMPORTANT]
You will not be able to use a probe move until your machine has been set
up to provide a probe input signal.
The probe input signal must be connected to 'motion.probe-input' in a .hal
file.
G38.n uses motion.probe-input to determine when the probe has made (or

TRUE for probe contact closed (touching), FALSE for probe contact open.

Program 'G38.n axes' to perform a straight probe operation.
The axis words are optional, except that at least one of them must be

The axis words together define the destination point that the probe will
move towards, starting from the current location.
If the probe is not tripped before the destination is reached G38.2 and
G38.4 will signal an error.

The tool in the spindle must be a probe or contact a probe switch.

In response to this command, the machine moves the controlled point
(which should be at the center of the probe ball) in a straight line at
the current <<sec:set-feed-rate,feed rate>> toward the programmed point.
In inverse time feed mode, the feed rate is such that the whole motion
from the current point to the programmed point would take the specified
time.
The move stops (within machine acceleration limits) when the programmed
point is reached, or when the requested change in the probe input takes
place, whichever occurs first.

  The P- tolerance means that the actual path will be no more than P-

  needed to maintain the path.
  If you set Q to a non-zero value it turns on the 'Naive CAM
  Detector': when there are a series of linear XYZ feed moves at the
  same <<sec:set-feed-rate,feed rate>> that are less than Q- away from
  being collinear, they are collapsed into a single linear move.
  On G2/G3 moves in the G17 (XY) plane when the maximum
  deviation of an arc from a straight line is less than the G64 P-
  tolerance the arc is broken into two lines (from start of arc to
  midpoint, and from midpoint to end). those lines are then subject to
  the naive cam algorithm for lines. Thus, line-arc, arc-arc, and
  arc-line cases as well as line-line benefit from the 'Naive CAM
  Detector'. This improves contouring performance by simplifying the
  path. It is OK to program for the mode that is already active. See
  also the <<sec:trajectory-control,Trajectory Control>> section for

The G71/G72 cycle is intended to rough cut a profile on a lathe. The G71
cycles remove layers of the material while traversing in the Z direction.
The G72 cycles remove material while traversing the X axis, the so called
facing cycle. The direction of travel is the same as in the path given in
the subroutine. For the G71 cycle the Z coordinate must be monotonically
changing, for the G72 this is required for the X axis.

The profile is given in a subroutine with number Q-. This subroutine
may contain G0, G1, G2 and G3 motion commands. All other commands are
ignored, including feed and speed settings. The <<gcode:g0>> commands are
interpreted as <<gcode:g1,G1>> commands. Each motion command may also
include an optional A- or C- number.  If the number A- is added a fillet
with the radius given by A will be inserted at the endpoint of that
motion, if this radius is too large the algorithm will fail with a
non-monotonic path error. It is also possible to use the C- number, which
allows a chamfer to be inserted. This chamfer has the same endpoints as
a fillet of the same dimension would have but a straight line is inserted
instead of an arc.

When in absolute mode the U (for X) and W (for Z) can be used as
incremental displacements.

The G7x.1 cycles do not cut pockets. The G7x.2 cycles only cut after the
first pocket and continue where G7x.1 stopped. It is advisible to leave
some additional material to cut before the G7x.2 cycle, so if G7x.1 used
a D1.0 the G7x.2 can use D0.5 and 0.5mm will be removed while moving
from one pocket to the next.

The normal G7x cycles cut the entire profile in one cycle.

  The final threading cut will be 'K' beyond the 'thread peak' position.

Optional settings

* '$-' - The spindle number to which the motion will be synchronised (default 0).
  For example if $1 is programmed then the motion will begin on the reset of `spindle.1.index-enable` and proceed in synchrony with the value of `spindle.1.revs`.
* 'R-' - The 'depth degression'. 'R1.0' selects constant depth on successive threading passes. 'R2.0' selects constant area.
  Values between 1.0 and 2.0 select decreasing depth but increasing area.
  Values above 2.0 select decreasing area.
  Beware that unnecessarily high degression values will cause a large number of passes to be used.
  (degression = a descent by stages or steps.)

[WARNING]
Unnecessarily high degression values will produce an unnecessarily high number of passes. (degressing = dive in stages)

* 'Q-' - The 'compound slide angle' is the angle (in degrees) describing to what extent successive passes should be offset along the drive line.
  This is used to cause one side of the tool to remove more material than the other.
  A positive 'Q' value causes the leading edge of the tool to cut more heavily.  Typical values are 29, 29.5 or 30.
* 'H-' - The number of 'spring passes'.
  Spring passes are additional passes at full thread depth.
  If no additional passes are desired, program 'H0'.

Thread entries and exits can be programmed tapered with the 'E' and 'L' values.

* 'E-' - Specifies the distance along the drive line used for the taper.
  The angle of the taper will be so the last pass tapers to the thread crest over the distance specified with E.
  'E0.2' will give a taper for the first/last 0.2 length units along the thread.
  For a 45 degree taper program E the same as K.
* 'L-' - Specifies which ends of the thread get the taper.
  Program 'L0' for no taper (the default), 'L1' for entry taper, 'L2'
  for exit taper, or 'L3' for both entry and exit tapers.
  Entry tapers will pause at the drive line to synchronize with the
  index pulse then move at the <<sec:set-feed-rate,feed rate>> in to the
  beginning of the taper. No entry taper and the tool will rapid to the
  cut depth then synchronize and begin the cut.

The tool is moved to the initial X and Z positions prior to issuing
the G76. The X position is the 'drive line' and the Z position is the
start of the threads.

The tool will pause briefly for synchronization before each threading
pass, so a relief groove will be required at the entry unless the
beginning of the thread is past the end of the material or an entry
taper is used.

Unless using an exit taper, the exit move is not synchronized to the
spindle speed and will be a <<gcode:g0,rapid move>>. With a slow spindle,
the exit move might take only a small fraction of a revolution. If the
spindle speed is increased after several passes are complete, subsequent
exit moves will require a larger portion of a revolution, resulting in a
very heavy cut during the exit move. This can be avoided by providing a
relief groove at the exit, or by not changing the spindle speed while
threading.

The final position of the tool will be at the end of the 'drive line'.
A safe Z move will be needed with an internal thread to remove the tool
from the hole.

== G80-G89 Canned Cycles(((G80-G89 Canned Cycles)))

The canned cycles 'G81' through 'G89' and the canned cycle stop 'G80'
are described in this section.

All canned cycles are performed with respect to the currently-selected
plane. Any of the nine planes may be selected. Throughout this section,
most of the descriptions assume the XY-plane has been selected. The
behavior is analogous if another plane is selected, and the correct
words must be used. For instance, in the 'G17.1' plane, the action of
the canned cycle is along W, and the locations
or increments are given with U and V. In this case substitute U,V,W for
X,Y,Z in the instructions below.

Rotary axis words are not allowed in canned cycles. When the
active plane is one of the XYZ family, the UVW axis words are not
allowed. Likewise, when the active plane is one of the UVW family, the
XYZ axis words are not allowed.

=== Common Words

All canned cycles use X, Y, Z, or U, V, W groups depending on the
plane selected and R words. The R (usually meaning retract) position is
along the axis perpendicular to the currently selected plane (Z-axis
for XY-plane, etc.) Some canned cycles use additional arguments.

=== Sticky Words

For canned cycles, we will call a number 'sticky' if, when the same
cycle is used on several lines of code in a row, the number must be
used the first time, but is optional on the rest of the lines. Sticky
numbers keep their value on the rest of the lines if they are not
explicitly programmed to be different. The R number is always sticky.

In incremental distance mode X, Y, and R numbers are treated as
increments from the current position and Z as an increment from the
Z-axis position before the move involving Z takes place. In absolute
distance mode, the X, Y, R, and Z numbers are absolute positions in the
current coordinate system.

=== Repeat Cycle

The L number is optional and represents the number of repeats.
L=0 is not allowed. If the repeat feature is used, it is
normally used in incremental distance mode, so that the same sequence
of motions is repeated in several equally spaced places along a
straight line. When L- is greater than 1 in incremental mode with the
XY-plane selected, the X and Y positions are determined by adding the
given X and Y numbers either to the current X and Y positions (on the
first go-around) or to the X and Y positions at the end of the previous
go-around (on the repetitions). Thus, if you program 'L10' , you will
get 10 cycles. The first cycle will be distance X,Y from
the original location. The R and Z positions do not change during the
repeats. The L number is not sticky. In absolute distance mode,
L>1 means 'do the same cycle in the same place several
times', Omitting the L word is equivalent to specifying L=1.

=== Retract Mode

The height of the retract move at the end of each repeat (called
'clear Z' in the descriptions below) is determined by the setting of
the retract mode, either to the original Z position (if that is above
the R position and the retract mode is 'G98', OLD_Z), or otherwise to
the R position. See the <<gcode:g98-g99,G98 G99>> section.

* or the R number is less than the Z number.

If other planes are active, the error conditions are analogous to the
XY conditions above.

[[gcode:preliminary-motion]]
=== Preliminary and In-Between Motion

Preliminary motion is a set of motions that is common to all of the
milling canned cycles. If the current Z position is below the R position,
the Z axis does a <<gcode:g0,rapid move>> to the R position. This happens
only once, regardless of the value of L.

In addition, at the beginning of the first cycle and each repeat, the
following one or two moves are made:

* A <<gcode:g0,rapid move>> parallel to the XY-plane to
  the given XY-position.
* The Z-axis make a rapid move to the R position, if it is
  not already at the R position.

If another plane is active, the preliminary and in-between motions are
analogous.

=== Why use a canned cycle?

There are at least two reasons for using canned cycles. The first is
the economy of code. A single bore would take several lines of code to
execute.

The G81 <<gcode:g81-example,Example 1>> demonstrates how a canned cycle
could be used to produce 8 holes with ten lines of G-code within the
canned cycle mode.
The program below will produce the same set of 8 holes using five lines
for the canned cycle. It does not follow exactly the same path nor does
it drill in the same order as the earlier example. But the program
writing economy of a good canned cycle should be obvious.

[NOTE]
Line numbers are not needed but help clarify these examples.

the Z value on the first line since it is higher than the specified R
value.

.Twelve Holes in a Square

This example demonstrates the use of the L word to repeat a set of
incremental drill cycles for successive blocks of code within the same
G81 motion mode. Here we produce 12 holes using five lines of code in
the canned motion mode.

image::images/twelve-holes_en.svg[align="center"]

The second reason to use a canned cycle is that they all produce
preliminary moves and returns that you can anticipate and control
regardless of the start point of the canned cycle.

[[gcode:g80]]
== G80 Cancel Canned Cycle(((G80 Cancel Modal Motion)))

* 'G80' - cancel canned cycle modal motion. 'G80' is part of modal group 1,
  so programming any other G-code from modal group 1 will also
  cancel the canned cycle.

It is an error if:

*  Axis words are programmed when G80 is active.

.G80 Example

----
G90 G81 X1 Y1 Z1.5 R2.8 (absolute distance canned cycle)

the previous code.

[source,{ngc}]
----
G90 G81 X1 Y1 Z1.5 R2.8 (absolute distance canned cycle)
G0 X0 Y0 Z0 (rapid move to coordinate home)
----

The advantage of the first set is that, the G80 line clearly turns off
the G81 canned cycle. With the first set of blocks, the programmer must
turn motion back on with G0, as is done in the next line, or any other
motion mode G word.

If a canned cycle is not turned off with G80 or another motion word, the
canned cycle will attempt to repeat itself using the next block of code
that contains an X, Y, or Z word. The following file drills (G81) a set
of eight holes as shown in the following caption.

[NOTE]
Notice the Z position change after the first four holes.
Also, this is one of the few places where line numbers have some value,
being able to point a reader to a specific line of code.

The use of G80 in line N200 is optional because the G0 on the next
line will turn off the G81 cycle. But using the G80 as shown in
Example 1, will provide for easier to read canned cycle. Without it, it
is not so obvious that all of the blocks between N120 and N200 belong
to the canned cycle.

This calls for absolute distance mode (G90) and OLD_Z retract mode
(G98) and calls for the G81 drilling cycle to be performed once.

* The Z value and Z position are 1.5.
* The R value and clear Z are 2.8. OLD_Z is 3.

The following moves take place:

* A rapid move move parallel to the Z-axis to (Z2.8).
* Move parallel to the Z-axis at the <<sec:set-feed-rate,feed rate>> to

----
G91 G98 G81 X4 Y5 Z-0.6 R1.8 L3
----

Suppose the current position is (X1, Y2, Z3) and the preceding line of
NC code is interpreted.

This calls for incremental distance mode (G91) and OLD_Z retract mode
(G98). It also calls for the G81 drilling cycle to be repeated three
times. The X value is 4, the Y value is 5, the Z value is -0.6 and the
R value is 1.8. The initial X position is 5 (=1+4), the initial Y
position is 7 (=2+5), the clear Z position is 4.8 (=1.8+3), and the Z
position is 4.2 (=4.8-0.6). OLD_Z is 3.

The first preliminary move is a maximum rapid move along the Z axis to
(X1,Y2,Z4.8), since OLD_Z < clear Z.

The first repeat consists of 3 moves.

* A <<gcode:g0,rapid move>> parallel to the XY-plane to (X5, Y7)
* Move parallel to the Z-axis at the <<sec:set-feed-rate,feed rate>> to
  (Z4.2)
* A rapid move parallel to the Z-axis to (X5, Y7, Z4.8)

The second repeat consists of 3 moves. The X position is reset to 9
(=5+4) and the Y position to 12 (=7+5).

* A <<gcode:g0,rapid move>> parallel to the XY-plane to (X9, Y12, Z4.8)
* Move parallel to the Z-axis at the feed rate to (X9, Y12, Z4.2)
* A rapid move parallel to the Z-axis to (X9, Y12, Z4.8)

The third repeat consists of 3 moves. The X position is reset to 13
(=9+4) and the Y position to 17 (=12+5).

* A <<gcode:g0,rapid move>> parallel to the XY-plane to (X13, Y17, Z4.8)
* Move parallel to the Z-axis at the feed rate to (X13, Y17, Z4.2)
* A rapid move parallel to the Z-axis to (X13, Y17, Z4.8)

----

Now suppose that you execute the first G81 block of code but from (X0,
Y0, Z0) rather than from (X1, Y2, Z3).

Since OLD_Z is below the R value, it adds
nothing for the motion but since the initial value of Z is less than
the value specified in R, there will be an initial Z move during the
preliminary moves.

This is a plot of the path of motion for the second g81 block of code.

----

Since this plot starts with (X0, Y0, Z0), the interpreter adds the
initial Z0 and R1.8 and rapid moves to that location. After that initial
Z move, the repeat feature works the same as it did in example 3 with
the final Z depth being 0.6 below the R value.

.Example 5 - Relative position R > Z

[source,{ngc}]
----
G90 G98 G81 X4 Y5 Z-0.6 R1.8
----

Since this plot starts with (X0, Y0, Z0), the interpreter adds the
initial Z0 and R1.8 and rapid moves to that location as in 'Example 4'.
After that initial Z move, the <<gcode:g0,rapid move>> to X4 Y5 is done.
Then the final Z depth being 0.6 below the R value. The repeat function
would make the Z move in the same location again.

The 'G83' cycle (often called peck drilling) is intended for deep

the hole of chips and cut off any long stringers (which are common when
drilling in aluminum). This cycle takes a Q number which represents a
'delta' increment along the Z-axis. The retract before final depth will
always be to the 'retract' plane even if G98 is in effect. The final
retract will honor the G98/99 in effect. G83 functions the same as G81
with the addition of retracts during the drilling operation. Peck clearance
can be specified by optional P number.

G92 axes
----

[WARNING]
Only use 'G92' after your machine has been positioned to the desired point.

'G92' makes the current point have the coordinates you want (without motion),
where the axis words contain the axis numbers you want.
All axis words are optional, except that at least one must be used.
If an axis word is not used for a given axis, the offset for that axis will be zero.

When 'G92' is executed, the <<sec:machine-coordinate-system,origins>>
of all coordinate systems move. They move such that the value of the
current controlled point, in the currently active coordinate system,
becomes the specified value. All of the coordinate system's origins
(G53-G59.3) are offset this same distance.

'G92' uses the values stored in <<sub:numbered-parameters,parameters>>
5211-5219 as the X Y Z A B C U V W offset values for each axis.
The parameter values are 'absolute' machine coordinates in the native machine 'units' as specified in the INI file.
All axes defined in the INI file will be offset when G92 is active.
If an axis was not entered following the G92, that axis' offset will be zero.

For example, suppose the current point is at X=4 and there is
currently no 'G92' offset active. Then 'G92 X7' is programmed.
This moves all origins -3 in X, which causes the current point to become X=7.
This -3 is saved in parameter 5211.

Being in incremental distance mode (G91 instead of G90) has no effect
on the action of `G92`.

'G92' offsets may be already be in effect when the `G92` is called.
If this is the case, the offset is replaced with a new
offset that makes the current point become the specified value.

It is an error if all axis words are omitted.

LinuxCNC stores the G92 offsets and reuses them on the next run of a
program. To prevent this, one can program a `G92.1` (to erase them), or
program a `G92.2` (to remove them - they are still stored).

[NOTE]
The 'G52' command can also be used to change this offset;
see the <<sec:g52-and-g92-offsets,Offsets>> section for more details about `G92` and `G52` and how they interact.

rate mode does not affect `G0` (<<gcode:g0,rapid move>>) motions.

* 'G94' - is Units per Minute Mode.
  In units per minute feed mode,
  an F word is interpreted to mean the controlled point should move at a certain number of inches per minute,
  millimeters per minute, or degrees per minute,
  depending upon what length units are being used and which axis or axes are moving.

* 'G95' - is Units per Revolution Mode
  In units per revolution mode,
  an F-word is interpreted to mean the controlled point should move a certain number of inches per revolution of the spindle,

  series of one or more contiguous canned cycles was started.
* 'G99' - retract to the position specified by the R word of the canned
  cycle.

Program a 'G98' and the canned cycle will use the Z position prior to
the canned cycle as the Z return position if it is higher than the R
value specified in the cycle. If it is lower, the R value will be
used. The R word has different meanings in absolute distance mode and
