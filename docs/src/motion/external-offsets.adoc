External axis offsets are supported during teleop (world) jogs
and coordinated (G-code) motion.  External axis offsets are
enabled on a per-axis basis by INI file settings and controlled
dynamically by INI input pins.  The INI interface is similar to
that used for wheel jogging.  This type of interface is
typically implemented with a manual-pulse-generator (mpg)
connected to an encoder INI component that counts pulses.

== INI File Settings

For each axis letter (*L* in xyzabcuvw):

[source,{ini}]
----
[AXIS_L]OFFSET_AV_RATIO = value (controls accel/vel for external offsets)
----

. Allowed values: 0 <= value <= 0.9
. Disallowed values are replaced with 0.1 with message to stdout
. Default value:  0 (disables external offset). +
  Consequence: omitted [AXIS_L]OFFSET_AV_RATIO disables external offset
  for the axis.
. If nonzero, the  OFFSET_AV_RATIO (*r*), adjusts the conventional
  (planning) max velocity and acceleration to preserve [AXIS_L]
  constraints:

----
planning max velocity        = (1-r) * MAX_VELOCITY
external offset velocity     = (  r) * MAX_VELOCITY

planning max acceleration    = (1-r) * MAX_ACCELERATION
external offset acceleration = (  r) * MAX_ACCELERATION

== HAL Pins

=== Per-Axis Motion HAL Pins

For each  axis letter (*L* in xyzabcuvw)

. *axis.L.eoffset-enable*  Input(bit): enable
. *axis.L.eoffset-scale*   Input(float): scale factor
. *axis.L.eoffset-counts*  Input(s32): input to counts register
. *axis.L.eoffset-clear*   Input(bit): clear requested offset
. *axis.L.eoffset*         Output(float): current external offset
. *axis.L.eoffset-request* Output(float): requested external offset

=== Other Motion HAL Pins

. *motion.eoffset-active*   Output(bit): non-zero external offsets applied
. *motion.eoffset-limited*  Output(bit): motion inhibited due to soft limit

== Usage

The axis input HAL pins (enable,scale,counts) are similar to the
pins used for wheel jogging.

=== Offset Computation

At each servo period, the 'axis.L.eoffset-counts' pin is compared to
its value in the prior period. The increase or decrease (positive
or negative delta) of the 'axis.L.eoffset-counts' pin is multiplied
by the current 'axis.L.eoffset-scale' pin value.  This product is
accumulated in an internal register and exported to the
'axis.L.eoffset-request' HAL pin. The accumulation register is reset
to zero at each machine-on.

The requested offset value is used to plan the movement for the
offset that is applied to the 'L' coordinate and represented
by the 'axis.L.eoffset' HAL pin. The planned motion respects the
allocated velocity and acceleration constraints and may be limited
if the net motion (offset plus teleop jogging or coordinated motion)
reaches a soft limit for the 'L' coordinate.

For many applications, the 'axis.L.eoffset-scale' pin is constant
and the net 'axis.L.eoffset-request' response to
'axis.L.eoffset-counts' is equivalent to the product of the
accumulated value of 'axis.L.eoffset-counts' and the (constant)
'axis.L.eoffset-scale' pin values.

=== Machine-off/Machine-on

When the machine is turned off, the *current position with
external offsets is maintained* so that there is no
unexpected motion at turn off or turn on.

At each startup (machine-on), the internal counts register for
each HAL pin 'axis.L.eoffset-counts' is zeroed and the
corresponding HAL output pin 'axis.L.eoffset' is reset to zero.

In other words, external offsets are *defined as ZERO at
each startup* (machine-on) regardless of the value of
the 'axis.L.eoffset-counts' pins. To avoid confusion, it is
recommended that all 'axis.L.eoffset-counts' pins are set to
zero when the machine is off.

=== Soft Limits

External axis offset movements are independently planned with
velocity and acceleration settings specified by the
'[AXIS_L]OFFSET_AV_RATIO'. The offsetting motion is not
coordinated with teleop jogs nor with coordinated (G-code)
motion. During teleop  jogging and coordinated (G-code) motion,
axis soft limits ('[AXIS_L]MIN_LIMIT,MAX_LIMIT') restrict
movement of the axis.

When external offsets are applied and motion reaches a soft limit
(by external offset increases or teleop jogging or coordinated
motion), the HAL pin 'motion.eoffset-limited' is asserted and the
axis value is held nominally to the soft limit.  This HAL pin can
be used by associated HAL logic to truncate additional eoffset
counts or to stop the machine (connect to 'halui.machine.off' for
instance). If the axis is moved within the soft limit, the
'motion.eoffset-limited' pin is reset.

When operating at a soft limit during coordinated motion that
continues to change the planned axis value, the HAL output pin
'axis.L.eoffset' will indicate the current offset -- the
distance needed to reach the limit instead of the computed
offset request. This indicated value will change as the
planned axis value changes.

The HAL pin 'axis.L.eoffset-request' indicates the current
requested offset that is the product of the internal counts
register and the eoffset-scale. In general, the 'axis.L.eoffset'
pin value lags the 'axis.L.eoffset-request' value since the
external offset is subject to an acceleration limit.
When operating at a soft limit, additional updates to the
'axis.L.eoffset-counts' will continue to affect the requested
external offset as reflected in the 'axis.L.eoffset-request' HAL
pin.

When teleop jogging with external offsets enabled *and*
non-zero values applied, encountering a soft limit will stop
motion in the offending axis *without a deacceleration interval*.
Similarly, during coordinated motion with external offsets
enabled, reaching a soft limit will stop motion with no
deacceleration phase. For this case, it does not matter if the
offsets are zero.

When motion is stopped with no deacceleration phase, system
*acceleration limits may be violated* and lead to: 1) a following
error (and/or a thump) for a servo motor system, 2) a loss of
steps for a stepper motor system.  In general, it is recommended
that external offsets are applied in a manner to avoid
approaching soft limits.

=== Notes

External offsets apply to axis coordinate letters (xyzabcuvw).
All joints must be homed before external axis offsets are
honored.

If an 'axis.L.eoffset-enable' HAL pin is reset when its offset is
non-zero, the offset is maintained.  The offset may be cleared by:

. a 'Machine-off/Machine on' toggle
. reactivating the enable pin and incrementing/decrementing the 'axis.L.eoffset-counts'
  HAL pin to return the offset to zero.
. pulsing the 'axis.L.eoffset-clear' HAL pin

External-offsets are intended for use with 'small' offsets that
are applied within the soft-limit bounds.

Soft limits are respected for both teleop jogging and coordinated
motion when external offsets are applied.  However, when a soft
limit is reached during coordinated motion, reducing the
offending external offset *may not move away* from the soft limit
*if planned motion continues in the same direction*.  This
circumstance can occur since the rate of correcting offset
removal (as set by '[AXIS_L]OFFSET_AV_RATIO') may be less than the
opposing planned rate of motion.  In such cases, *pausing* (or
stopping) the planned, coordinated motion will allow movement
away from the soft limit when correcting changes are made in the
offending external offset.

=== Warning

The use of external offsets can alter machine motion in a
significant manner.  The control of external offsets with HAL
components and connections and any associated user interfaces
should be carefully designed and tested before deployment.

== Related HAL Components

=== eoffset_per_angle.comp

Component to compute an external offset from a function based
on a measured angle (rotary coordinate or spindle).  See the
man page for details (*$ man eoffset_per_angle*).

== Testing

The external axis offset capability is enabled by adding
an '[AXIS_L]' setting for each candidate axis.  For example:

[source,{ini}]
----
[AXIS_Z]
OFFSET_AV_RATIO = 0.2
----

For testing, it is convenient to simulate a jog wheel interface using the
*sim_pin* GUI.  For example, in a terminal:

----
$ sim_pin axis.z.eoffset-enable axis.z.eoffset-scale axis.z.eoffset-counts
----

The use of external offsets is aided by displaying information
related to the current offsets: the current eoffset value and the
requested eoffset value, the axis pos-cmd, and (for an identity
kinematics machine) the corresponding joint motor pos-cmd and
motor-offset.  The provided sim configuration (see below)
demonstrates an example PyVCP panel for the AXIS GUI.

In the absence of a custom display, *halshow* can be started as
an auxiliary application with a custom watch list.

Example INI file settings to simulate the HAL pin
eoffset connections and display eoffset information for the
z axis (for identity kinematics with z==joint2):

[source,{ini}]
----
[APPLICATIONS]
APP = sim_pin \
      axis.z.eoffset-enable \
      axis.z.eoffset-scale \
      axis.z.eoffset-counts \
      axis.z.eoffset-clear

APP = halshow --fformat "%0.5f" ./z.halshow
----

Where the file z.halshow (in the configuration directory) is:

----
pin+joint.2.motor-pos-cmd
pin+joint.2.motor-offset
pin+axis.z.pos-cmd
pin+axis.z.eoffset
pin+axis.z.eoffset-request
pin+motion.eoffset-limited
----

== Examples

Provided simulation configurations demonstrate the use of
external offsets in order to provide a starting point for user
customization for real hardware.

The sim configurations utilize the INI setting '[HAL]HALFILE =
LIB:basic_sim.tcl' to configure all routine HAL connections for
the axes specified in the INI file '[TRAJ]COORDINATES=' setting.
The HAL logic needed to demonstrate external offset functionality
and the GUI HAL pin connections for a PyVCP panel are made in
separate HAL files.   A non-simulation configuration should
replace the 'LIB:basic_sim.tcl' item HALFILEs appropriate to the
machine.  The provided PyVCP files (.hal and .xml) could be a
starting point for application-specific GUI interfaces.

=== eoffsets.ini

The sim config 'sim/configs/axis/external_offsets/eoffsets.ini'

values.

A sim_pin GUI provides controls for the axis offset pins: eoffset-scale
& eoffset-counts (via signal e:<L>counts), eoffset-clear
(via signal e:clearall)

A script (eoffsets_monitor.tcl) is used to set 'axis.L.counts' pins to
zero at Machine-off.

=== opa.ini (eoffset_per_angle)

The opa.ini configuration uses the INI component eoffset_per_angle
(*$ man eoffset_per_angle*) to demonstrate an XZC machine with functional
offsets computed from the C coordinate (angle) and applied to
the transverse (X) coordinate.  Offset computations are based on
a specified reference radius typically set by a program (or MDI)
M68 command to control a *motion.analog-out-NN* pin.

Panel LEDs are provided to show important status items.

Functions are provided for inside and outside polygons (nsides >= 3),
sine waves and square waves.  The functions can be multiplied in
frequency using the fmul pin and modified in amplitude using the rfrac
pin (fraction of reference radius).
