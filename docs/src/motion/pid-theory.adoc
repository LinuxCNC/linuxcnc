== PID Controller

A proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID controller) is a
common feedback loop component in industrial control
systems. footnote:[This Subsection is taken from an much more extensive
article found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller]

The Controller compares a measured value from a process (typically an
industrial process) with a reference set point value. The difference
(or 'error' signal) is then used to calculate a new value for a
manipulable input to the process that brings the process measured value
back to its desired set point.

Unlike simpler control algorithms, the PID controller can adjust
process outputs based on the history and rate of change of the error
signal, which gives more accurate and stable control. (It can be shown
mathematically that a PID loop will produce accurate, stable control in
cases where a simple proportional control would either have a
steady-state error or would cause the process to oscillate).

=== Control loop basics

Intuitively, the PID loop tries to automate what an intelligent
operator with a gauge and a control knob would do. The operator would
read a gauge showing the output measurement of a process, and use the
knob to adjust the input of the process (the 'action') until the
process's output measurement stabilizes at the desired value on the
gauge.

In older control literature this adjustment process is called a
'reset' action. The position of the needle on the gauge is a
'measurement', 'process value' or 'process variable'. The desired value
on the gauge is called a 'set point' (also called 'set value'). The
difference between the gauge's needle and the set point is the 'error'.

A control loop consists of three parts:

. Measurement by a sensor connected to the process (e.g. encoder),
. Decision in a controller element,
. Action through an output device such as an motor.

As the controller reads a sensor, it subtracts this measurement from
the 'set point' to determine the 'error'. It then uses the error to
calculate a correction to the process's input variable (the 'action')
so that this correction will remove the error from the process's output
measurement.

In a PID loop, correction is calculated from the error in three ways:
cancel out the current error directly (Proportional), the amount of
time the error has continued uncorrected (Integral), and anticipate the
future error from the rate of change of the error over time
(Derivative).

A PID controller can be used to control any measurable variable which
can be affected by manipulating some other process variable. For
example, it can be used to control temperature, pressure, flow rate,
chemical composition, speed, or other variables. Automobile cruise
control is an example of a process outside of industry which utilizes
crude PID control.

Some control systems arrange PID controllers in cascades or networks.
That is, a 'master' control produces signals used by 'slave'
controllers. One common situation is motor controls: one often wants
the motor to have a controlled speed, with the 'slave' controller
(often built into a variable frequency drive) directly managing the
speed based on a proportional input. This 'slave' input is fed by the
'master' controller's output, which is controlling based upon a related
variable.

=== Theory

'PID' is named after its three correcting calculations, which all add
to and adjust the controlled quantity. These additions are actually
'subtractions' of error, because the proportions are usually negative:

.Proportional
To handle the present, the error is multiplied by a (negative)
constant P (for 'proportional'), and added to (subtracting error from)
the controlled quantity. P is only valid in the band over which a
controller's output is proportional to the error of the system. Note
that when the error is zero, a proportional controller's output is
zero.

.Integral
To learn from the past, the error is integrated (added up) over a
period of time, and then multiplied by a (negative) constant I (making
an average), and added to (subtracting error from) the controlled
quantity. I averages the measured error to find the process output's
average error from the set point. A simple proportional system either
oscillates, moving back and forth around the set point because there's
nothing to remove the error when it overshoots, or oscillates and/or
stabilizes at a too low or too high value. By adding a negative
proportion of (i.e. subtracting part of) the average error from the
process input, the average difference between the process output and
the set point is always being reduced. Therefore, eventually, a
well-tuned PID loop's process output will settle down at the set point.

.Derivative
To handle the future, the first derivative (the slope of the error)
over time is calculated, and multiplied by another (negative) constant
D, and also added to (subtracting error from) the controlled quantity.
The derivative term controls the response to a change in the system.
The larger the derivative term, the more rapidly the controller
responds to changes in the process's output.

More technically, a PID loop can be characterized as a filter applied
to a complex frequency-domain system. This is useful in order to
calculate whether it will actually reach a stable value. If the values
are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can oscillate, and
the process output may never stay at the set point.

=== Loop Tuning

'Tuning' a control loop is the adjustment of its control parameters
(gain/proportional band, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to
the optimum values for the desired control response. The optimum
behavior on a process change or set point change varies depending on
the application. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the
process variable from the set point. Other processes must minimize the
energy expended in reaching a new set point. Generally stability of
response is required and the process must not oscillate for any
combination of process conditions and set points.

Tuning of loops is made more complicated by the response time of the
process; it may take minutes or hours for a set point change to produce
a stable effect. Some processes have a degree of non-linearity and so
parameters that work well at full-load conditions don't work when the
process is starting up from no-load. This section describes some
traditional manual methods for loop tuning.

There are several methods for tuning a PID loop. The choice of method
will depend largely on whether or not the loop can be taken 'offline'
for tuning, and the response speed of the system. If the system can be
taken offline, the best tuning method often involves subjecting the
system to a step change in input, measuring the output as a function of
time, and using this response to determine the control parameters.

.Simple method
If the system must remain on line, one tuning method is to first set
the I and D values to zero. Increase the P until the output of the loop
oscillates. Then increase I until oscillation stops. Finally, increase
D until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference. A fast PID
loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the set point more
quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot.

Effects of increasing parameters

.Ziegler-Nichols method Another tuning method is formally known as the
'Ziegler-Nichols method', introduced by John G. Ziegler and Nathaniel
B. Nichols in 1942 footnote:[Ziegler, J. G. and Nichols, N. B. (1942),
'Optimum Settings for Automatic Controllers', Transactions of the
ASME, link:https://doi.org/10.1115/1.2899060[DOI 10.1115/1.2899060]
and link:https://web.archive.org/web/20170918055307/http://staff.guilan.ac.ir/staff/users/chaibakhsh/fckeditor_repo/file/documents/Optimum%20Settings%20for%20Automatic%20Controllers%20(Ziegler%20and%20Nichols,%201942).pdf[The
Internet Archive].]. It starts in the same way as the method described
before: first set the I and D gains to zero and then increase the P
gain and expose the loop to external interference for example knocking
the motor axis to cause it to move out of equilibrium in order to
determine critical gain and period of oscillation until the output of
the loop starts to oscillate.  Write down the critical gain (K~c~) and
the oscillation period of the output (P~c~). Then adjust the P, I and
D controls as the table shows:

.Final Steps
After tuning the axis check the following error with Halscope to make
sure it is within your machine requirements. More information on
Halscope is in the HAL User manual.

=== Automatic PID tuning

Since LinuxCNC version 2.9, the pid component support automatic tuning
using the Relay method footnote:[Åström, Karl Johan and Hägglund, Tore
(1984), 'Automation paper Automatic Tuning of Simple Regulators with
Specifications on Phase and Amplitude Margins',
link:https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(84)90014-1[DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(84)90014-1]].
This is a replacement for the now removed and obsolete at_pid
component.

The pid component uses several constants to calculate the output value
based on current and wanted state, the most important among them being
Pgain', 'Igain', 'Dgain', 'bias', 'FF0', 'FF1', 'FF2' and 'FF3'. All
of these need to have a sensible value for the controller to behave
properly.

The current implementation of automatic tuning implement two different
algorithms, selected using the tune-type pin.  When tune-type is zero,
it affects 'Pgain', 'Igain' and 'Dgain' while setting 'FF0', 'FF1' and
'FF2' to zero.  If tune-type is 1, it affects 'Pgain', 'Igain' and
'FF1' while setting 'Dgain', 'FF0' and 'FF2' to zero.  Note type 1
require scaling be set so output is in user units per second.

When autotuning a motor with tune-type 0, the algorithm will produce a
square wave pattern centered around the 'bias' value on the output pin
of the PID controller, moving from the positive extreme to the
negative extreme of the output range.  This can be seen using the HAL
Scope provided by LinuxCNC.  For a motor controller taking +-10 V as
its control signal, this might accelerate the motor full speed in one
direction for a short period before telling it to go full speed in the
opposite direction.  Make sure to have a lot of room on either side of
the starting position, and start with a low `tune-effort` value to
limit the speed used.  The `tune-effort` value define the extreme
`output` value used, so if `tune-effort` is 1, the `output` value
during tuning will move from 1 to -1. In other words, the extremes of
the wave pattern is controlled by the 'tune-effort' pin.  Using too
high 'tune-effort' might overload the motor driver.

The number of cycles in the tune pattern is controlled by the
'tune-cycles' pin.  Of course, trying to change the direction of a
physical object instantly (as in going directly from a positive
voltage to the equivalent negative voltage in the motor controller
case) do not change velocity instantly, and it take some time for the
object to slow down and move in the opposite direction.  This result
in a more smooth wave form on the position pin, as the axis in
question were vibrating back and forth.  When the axis reached the
target speed in the opposing direction, the auto tuner change
direction again.  After several of these changes, the average time
delay between the "peaks" and "valleys" of this movement graph is used
to calculate proposed values for `Pgain`, `Igain` and `Dgain`, and
insert them into the HAL model to use by the pid controller.  The auto
tuned settings are not perfect, but might provide a good starting
point for further parameter tuning.

FIXME: The author of these instructions have not tested automatic
tuning with tune-type set to 1, so this approach remain to be
documented.

Armed with this knowledge, it is time to look at how to do the tuning.
Lets say the HAL configuration in question load the PID component for
X, Y and Z like this, using named pin names instead of 'count=3':

 loadrt pid names=pid.x,pid.y,pid.z

If the component had used 'count=3' instead, all use of pid.x, pid,y
and pid.z need to be changed to pid.1, pid.2 and pid.3 respectively.
To start tuning the X axis, move the axis to the middle of its range,
to make sure it do not hit anything when it start moving back and
forth.  You also want to extend the axis ferror limit (following
error) to make LinuxCNC accept the higher position deviation during
tuning.  The sensible ferror limit depends on the machine and setup, but
1 inch or 20 mm might be useful starting points.  Next, set the
initial 'tune-effort' to a low number in the output range, for example
1/100 of the maximum output, and slowly increase it to get more
accurate tuning values.  Assign 1 to the 'tune-mode' value.  Note,
this will disable the pid controlling part and feed the 'bias' value
to the output pin, which can cause a lot of drift.  It might be a good
idea to tune the motor driver to ensure zero input voltage do not
cause any motor rotation, or adjust the 'bias' value for the same
effect.  Finally, after setting 'tune-mode', set 'tune-start' to 1 to
activate the auto tuning.  If all go well, your axis will vibrate and
move back and forth for a few seconds and when it is done, new values
for Pgain, Igain and Dgain will be active.  To test them, change
'tune-mode' back to 0.  Note that setting 'tune-mode' back to zero
might cause the axis to suddenly jerk as it bring the axis back to its
commanded position, which it might have drifted away from during
tuning.  To summarize, these are the halcmd instructions you need to
issue to do automatic tuning:

 setp pid.x.tune-effort 0.1
 setp pid.x.tune-mode 1
 setp pid.x.tune-start 1
 # wait for the tuning to complete
 setp pid.x.tune-mode 0

A script to help doing the automatic tuning is provided in the
LinuxCNC code repository as 'scripts/run-auto-pid-tuner'.  This will
ensure the machine is powered on and ready to run, home all axes if it
is not already done, check that the extra tuning pins are available,
move the axis to its mid point, run the auto tuning and re-enable the
pid controller when it is done.  It can be run several times.
