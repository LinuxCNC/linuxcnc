== Introduction

When we talk about CNC machines, we usually think about machines that
are commanded to move to certain locations and perform various tasks.
In order to have an unified view of the machine space, and to make it
fit the human point of view over 3D space, most of the machines (if not
all) use a common coordinate system called the Cartesian Coordinate
System.

The Cartesian Coordinate system is composed of three axes (X, Y, Z) each
perpendicular to the other two. footnote:[The word “axes” is also
commonly (and wrongly) used when talking about
CNC machines, and referring to the moving directions of the machine.]

When we talk about a G-code program (RS274/NGC) we talk about a number
of commands (G0, G1, etc.) which have positions as parameters (X- Y-
Z-). These positions refer exactly to Cartesian positions. Part of the
LinuxCNC motion controller is responsible for translating those positions
into positions which correspond to the machine
(((kinematics)))kinematics. footnote:[Kinematics: a two way function to
transform from Cartesian space to joint space]

=== Joints vs. Axes

A joint of a CNC machine is a one of the physical degrees of freedom
of the machine. This might be linear (leadscrews) or rotary (rotary
tables, robot arm joints). There can be any number of joints on a
given machine. For example, one popular robot has 6 joints, and a
typical simple milling machine has only 3.

There are certain machines where the joints are laid out to match
kinematics axes (joint 0 along axis X, joint 1 along axis Y, joint 2
along axis Z), and these machines are called (((Cartesian
machines)))Cartesian machines (or machines with (((Trivial
Kinematics)))Trivial Kinematics). These are the most common machines
used in milling, but are not very common in other domains of machine
control (e.g. welding: puma-typed robots).

LinuxCNC supports axes with names: X Y Z A B C U V W.  The X Y Z axes
typically refer to the usual Cartesian coordinates. The A B C axes refer to
rotational coordinates about the X Y Z axes respectively.  The U V W axes refer to
additional coordinates that are commonly made colinear to the X Y Z axes respectively.

== Trivial Kinematics

The simplest machines are those in which which each joint is placed
along one of the Cartesian axes. On these machines the mapping from
Cartesian space (the G-code program) to the joint space (the actual
actuators of the machine) is trivial. It is a simple 1:1 mapping:

----
pos->tran.x = joints[0];
pos->tran.y = joints[1];
pos->tran.z = joints[2];
----

In the above code snippet one can see how the mapping is done: the X
position is identical with the joint 0, the Y position with
joint 1, etc. The above refers to the direct kinematics (one
direction of the transformation).
The next code snippet refers to the inverse kinematics (or the
inverse direction of the transformation):

----
joints[0] = pos->tran.x;
joints[1] = pos->tran.y;
joints[2] = pos->tran.z;
----

In LinuxCNC, the identity kinematics are implemented with the
'trivkins' kinematics module and extended to 9 axes.  The default
relationships between axis coordinates and joint numbers are:

----
pos->tran.x = joints[0];
pos->tran.y = joints[1];
pos->tran.z = joints[2];
pos->a      = joints[3];
pos->b      = joints[4];
pos->c      = joints[5];
pos->u      = joints[6];
pos->v      = joints[7];
pos->w      = joints[8];
----

Similarly, the default relationships for inverse kinematics for trivkins
are:

----
joints[0] = pos->tran.x;
joints[1] = pos->tran.y;
joints[2] = pos->tran.z;
joints[3] = pos->a;
joints[4] = pos->b;
joints[5] = pos->c;
joints[6] = pos->u;
joints[7] = pos->v;
joints[8] = pos->w;
----

It is straightforward to do the transformation for a trivial "kins" ('trivkins'
kinematics) or Cartesian machine provided that there are no omissions in the
axis letters used.

It gets a bit more complicated if the machine is missing one or more of the
axis letters.  The problems of omitted axis letters is addressed by using the
'coordinates=' module parameter with the trivkins module.  Joint numbers are
assigned consecutively to each coordinate specified.  A lathe can be described
with 'coordinates=xz' The joint assignments will then be:

----
joints[0] = pos->tran.x
joints[1] = pos->tran.z
----

Use of the 'coordinates=' parameter is recommended for configurations that omit
axis letters. footnote:[ Historically, the trivkins module did not support the
'coordinates=' parameter so lathe configs were often configured as XYZ
machines.  The unused Y axis was configured to 1) home immediately, 2) use a
simple loopback to connect its position command hal pin to its position
feedback hal pin, and 3) hidden in gui displays.   Numerous sim configs use
these methods in order to share common hal files.]

The 'trivkins' kinematics module also allows the same coordinate to be specified
for more than one joint.  This feature can be useful on machines like a gantry
having two independent motors for the y coordinate.  Such a machine could use
'coordinates=xyyz' resulting in joint assignments:

----
joints[0] = pos->tran.x
joints[1] = pos->tran.y
joints[2] = pos->tran.y
joints[3] = pos->tran.z
----

See the trivkins man pages for more information.

== Non-trivial kinematics

There can be quite a few types of machine setups (robots: puma, scara;
hexapods etc.). Each of them is set up using linear and rotary joints.
These joints don't usually match with the Cartesian coordinates,
therefore we need a kinematics function which does the
conversion (actually 2 functions: forward and inverse kinematics
function).

To illustrate the above, we will analyze a simple kinematics called
bipod (a simplified version of the tripod, which is a simplified
version of the hexapod).

.Bipod setup

image::images/bipod.png[alt="Bipod setup"]

The Bipod we are talking about is a device that consists of 2 motors
placed on a wall, from which a device is hung using some wire. The
joints in this case are the distances from the motors to the device
(named AD and BD in the figure).

The position of the motors is fixed by convention. Motor A is in
(0,0), which means that its X coordinate is 0, and its Y coordinate is
also 0. Motor B is placed in (Bx, 0), which means that its X coordinate
is Bx.

Our tooltip will be in point D which gets defined by the distances AD
and BD, and by the Cartesian coordinates Dx, Dy.

The job of the kinematics is to transform from joint lengths (AD, BD)
to Cartesian coordinates (Dx, Dy) and vice-versa.

=== Forward transformation

To transform from joint space into Cartesian space we will use some
trigonometry rules (the right triangles determined by the points (0,0),
(Dx,0), (Dx,Dy) and the triangle (Dx,0), (Bx,0) and (Dx,Dy).

We can easily see that image:images/kinematics-math-01.png[],
likewise image:images/kinematics-math-02.png[]

If we subtract one from the other we will get:

image::images/kinematics-math-03.png[align="center"]

and therefore:

image::images/kinematics-math-04.png[align="center"]

From there we calculate:

image::images/kinematics-math-05.png[align="center"]

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
we can easily see that latexmath:[$AD^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$], likewise
latexmath:[$BD^{2}=(Bx-x)^{2}+y^{2}$].

If we subtract one from the other we will get:

latexmath::[\[AD^{2}-BD^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}-x^{2}+2*x*Bx-Bx^{2}-y^{2}\]]

and therefore:

latexmath::[\[x=\frac{AD^{2}-BD^{2}+Bx^{2}}{2*Bx}\]]

From there we calculate:

latexmath::[\[y=\sqrt{AD^{2}-x^{2}}\]]
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Note that the calculation for y involves the square root of a
difference, which may not result in a real number. If there is no
single Cartesian coordinate for this joint position, then the position
is said to be a singularity. In this case, the forward kinematics
return -1.

Translated to actual code:

----
double AD2 = joints[0] * joints[0];
double BD2 = joints[1] * joints[1];
double x = (AD2 - BD2 + Bx * Bx) / (2 * Bx);
double y2 = AD2 - x * x;
if(y2 < 0) return -1;
pos->tran.x = x;
pos->tran.y = sqrt(y2);
return 0;
----

=== Inverse transformation

The inverse kinematics is lots easier in our example, as we can write
it directly:

image::images/kinematics-math-06.png[align="center"]

image::images/kinematics-math-07.png[align="center"]

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
latexmath::[\[AD=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\]]

latexmath::[\[BD=\sqrt{(Bx-x)^{2}+y^{2}}\]]
////////////////////////////////////////////////

or translated to actual code:

----
double x2 = pos->tran.x * pos->tran.x;
double y2 = pos->tran.y * pos->tran.y;
joints[0] = sqrt(x2 + y2);
joints[1] = sqrt((Bx - pos->tran.x)*(Bx - pos->tran.x) + y2);
return 0;
----

== Implementation details

A kinematics module is implemented as a HAL component, and is
permitted to export pins and parameters. It consists of several “C”
functions (as opposed to HAL functions):

----
int kinematicsForward(const double *joint, EmcPose *world,
const KINEMATICS_FORWARD_FLAGS *fflags,
KINEMATICS_INVERSE_FLAGS *iflags)
----

Implements the forward kinematics function.

----
int kinematicsInverse(const EmcPose * world, double *joints,
const KINEMATICS_INVERSE_FLAGS *iflags,
KINEMATICS_FORWARD_FLAGS *fflags)
----

Implements the inverse kinematics function.

----
KINEMATICS_TYPE kinematicsType(void)
----

Returns the kinematics type identifier, typically 'KINEMATICS_BOTH'.

----
int kinematicsHome(EmcPose *world, double *joint,
KINEMATICS_FORWARD_FLAGS *fflags,
KINEMATICS_INVERSE_FLAGS *iflags)
----

The home kinematics function sets all its arguments to their proper
values at the known home position. When called, these should be set,
when known, to initial values, e.g., from an INI file. If the home
kinematics can accept arbitrary starting points, these initial values
should be used.

----
int rtapi_app_main(void)
void rtapi_app_exit(void)
----

These are the standard setup and tear-down functions of RTAPI modules.

When they are contained in a single source file, kinematics modules
may be compiled and installed by 'halcompile'. See the 'halcompile(1)' manpage or
the HAL manual for more information.
