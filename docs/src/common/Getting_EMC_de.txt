= About LinuxCNC

== The Software

* LinuxCNC (the Enhanced Machine Control) is a software system for computer
  control of machine tools such as milling machines and lathes, robots
  such as puma and scara and other computer controlled machines up to 9 axes.
* LinuxCNC is free software with open source code. Current versions of LinuxCNC
  are entirely licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser
  GNU General Public License (GPL and LGPL)
* LinuxCNC provides:
** a graphical user interface (actually several interfaces to choose from)
** an interpreter for 'G-code' (the RS-274 machine tool programming language)
** a realtime motion planning system with look-ahead
** operation of low-level machine electronics such as sensors and motor drives
** an easy to use 'breadboard' layer for quickly creating a unique 
   configuration for your machine
** a software PLC programmable with ladder diagrams
** easy installation with a Live-CD
* It does not provide drawing (CAD - Computer Aided Design) or G-code
  generation from the drawing (CAM - Computer Automated Manufacturing)
  functions.
* It can simultaneously move up to 9 axes and supports a variety of
  interfaces.
* The control can operate true servos (analog or PWM) with the feedback
  loop closed by the LinuxCNC software at the computer, or open loop with
  step-servos or stepper motors.
* Motion control features include: cutter radius and length
  compensation, path deviation limited to a specified tolerance, lathe
  threading, synchronized axis motion, adaptive feedrate, operator feed
  override, and constant velocity control.
* Support for non-Cartesian motion systems is provided via custom
  kinematics modules. Available architectures include hexapods (Stewart
  platforms and similar concepts) and systems with rotary joints to
  provide motion such as PUMA or SCARA robots.
* LinuxCNC runs on Linux using real time extensions. 

== The Operating System

Ubuntu has been chosen because it fits perfectly into the Open Source
views of LinuxCNC:

 - Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for
   the 'enterprise edition', we make our very best work available to
   everyone on the same Free terms.
 - LinuxCNC is paired with the LTS versions of Ubuntu which provide support
   and security fixes from the Ubuntu team for 3 - 5 years.
 - Ubuntu uses the very best in translations and accessibility
   infrastructure that the Free Software community has to offer, to make
   Ubuntu usable for as many people as possible.
 - The Ubuntu community is entirely committed to the principles of free
   software development; we encourage people to use open source software,
   improve it and pass it on.

== Getting Help

=== IRC

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. 
It is a live connection to other LinuxCNC users. 
The LinuxCNC IRC channel is #linuxcnc on freenode.

The simplest way to get on the IRC is to use 
the embedded java client on this 
http://www.linuxcnc.org/index.php/english/community[page].

Some IRC etiquette::

 - Ask specific questions... Avoid questions like "Can someone help me?". 
 - If you're really new to all this, think a bit about your question 
   before typing it. Make sure you give enough information so 
   someone can solve your question. 
 - Have some patience when waiting for an answer, sometimes it takes a 
   while to formulate an answer or everyone might be busy working or 
   something. 
 - Set up your IRC account with your unique name so people will know who 
   you are. If you use the java client, use the same name every time you 
   log in. This helps people remember who you are and if you have been on 
   before many will remember the past discussions which 
   saves time on both ends.

Sharing Files::
The most common way to share files on the IRC is to upload the file 
to one of the following or a similar service and paste the link:

* 'For text' - http://pastebin.com/ , http://pastie.org/, https://gist.github.com/

* 'For pictures' - http://imagebin.org/ , http://imgur.com/ , http://bayimg.com/

* 'For files' - http://filedropper.com/ , http://filefactory.com/ , http://1fichier.com/

=== Mailing List

An Internet Mailing List is a way to put questions out for everyone on
that list to see and answer at their convenience. You get better
exposure to your questions on a mailing list than on the IRC but
answers take longer. In a nutshell you e-mail a message to the list and
either get daily digests or individual replies back depending on how
you set up your account.

The CD image below has the old LinuxCNC 2.3.x on it, but can be upgraded to 
2.4.x by following instructions on the LinuxCNC.org wiki here: 
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?UpdatingTo2.4

For the USA mirror: 
wget http://www.linuxcnc.org/hardy/ubuntu-8.04-desktop-emc2-aj13-i386.iso

For the European mirror: 
wget http://dsplabs.upt.ro/~juve/emc/get.php?file=ubuntu-8.04-desktop-emc2-aj13-i386.iso

The md5sum of the above file is: '1bab052ec879f941628927c988863f14'
*********************************************************************
+
After the download is complete you will find the ISO file in the 
directory that you selected. Next we will burn the CD.

Wget Windows:: (((Wget Windows)))
The wget program is also available for Windows from: 
+
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm
+
Follow the instructions on the web page for downloading and installing
the windows version of the wget program.
+
To run wget open a command prompt window.
+
In most Windows it is Programs/Accessories/Command Prompt
+
First you have to change to the directory where wget is installed in.
+
Typically it is in C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin so 
in the Command Prompt window type:
+
----
cd C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin
----
+
and the prompt should change to: 'C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin>'
+
Type the wget command into the window and press enter as above.

=== Burning the CD

LinuxCNC is distributed as CD image files, called ISOs. 
To install LinuxCNC, you first need to burn the ISO file onto a CD. 
You need a working CD/DVD burner and an 80 minute (700 Mb) CD for this. 
If the CD writing fails, try writing at a slower burn speed. 

Verify md5sum in Linux::

Before burning a CD, it is highly recommended that you verify the 
md5sum (hash) of the .iso file.
+
Open a terminal window. 
In Ubuntu it is Applications/Accessories/Terminal.
+
Change to the directory where the ISO was downloaded to.
+
----
cd download_directory
----
+
Then run the md5sum command with the file name you saved.
+
----
md5sum -b ubuntu-10.04-linuxcnc1-i386.iso
----
+
The md5sum should print out a single line after 
calculating the hash. 
On slower computers this might take a minute or two.
+
----
5283b33b7e23e79da1ee561ad476b05f *ubuntu-10.04-linuxcnc1-i386.iso
----
+
Now compare it to the md5sum value that it should be.
+
If you downloaded the md5sum as well as the iso, 
you can ask the md5sum program to do the checking for you. 
In the same directory: 
+
----
md5sum -c ubuntu-10.04-linuxcnc1-i386.iso.md5
----
+
If all is well, after a short delay the terminal will print: 
+
----
ubuntu-10.04-linuxcnc1-i386.iso: OK
----

Burning the ISO in Linux::

 . Insert a blank CD into your burner. A 'CD/DVD Creator' or 
   'Choose Disc Type' window will pop up. 
   Close this, as we will not be using it.
 . Browse to the downloaded ISO image in the file browser.
 . Right click on the ISO image file and choose Write to Disc.
 . Select the write speed. If you are burning a Ubuntu Live CD, it is
   recommended that you write at the lowest possible speed.
 . Start the burning process.
 . If a 'choose a file name for the disc image' window pops up, just pick OK.

Verify md5sum with Windows::

Before burning a CD, it is highly recommended that you verify the md5
sum (hash) of the .iso file, to ensure that you got a good download.
+
Windows does not come with a md5sum program. You will have to download
and install one to check the md5sum. More information can be found at:
+
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM

Burning the ISO in Windows::

 . Download and install Infra Recorder, a free and open source image
   burning program: http://infrarecorder.org/
 . Insert a blank CD in the drive and select Do nothing or Cancel if an
   auto-run dialog pops up.
 . Open Infra Recorder, and select the 
   'Actions' menu, then 'Burn image'.

=== Testing LinuxCNC

With the Live CD in the CD/DVD drive shut down the computer then turn
the computer back on. This will boot the computer from the Live CD.
Once the computer has booted up you can try out LinuxCNC without installing
it. You can not create custom configurations or modify most system
settings like screen resolution unless you install LinuxCNC.

To try out LinuxCNC from the Applications/CNC menu pick LinuxCNC. Then select
a sim configuration to try out.

To see if your computer is suitable for software step pulse generation
run the Latency Test as shown <<latency-test,here>>.

=== Installing LinuxCNC

If you like what you see, just click the Install icon on the desktop,
answer a few questions (your name, timezone, password) and the install
completes in a few minutes. Make sure you write down the name you used
and the password. Once the install process is complete and you go on
line the update manager will pop up and allow you to upgrade to the
latest stable version of LinuxCNC.

=== Updates to LinuxCNC (((Updates to LinuxCNC)))

With the normal install the Update Manager will notify you of updates
to LinuxCNC when you go on line and allow you to easily upgrade with no
Linux knowledge needed. 
If you want to upgrade to 10.04 from 8.04 a
clean install from the Live-CD is recommended. 
It is OK to upgrade everything except the operating system when asked to.

Warning: Do not upgrade Ubuntu to a new but non-LTS version 
(like 8.04 to 8.10) as it will prevent LinuxCNC from running.

=== Install Problems

In rare cases you might have to reset the BIOS to default settings if
during the Live CD install it cannot recognize the hard drive 
during the boot up.
