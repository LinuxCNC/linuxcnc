Parport
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Parport}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Parport is a driver for the traditional PC parallel port.
 The port has a total of 17 physical pins.
 The original parallel port divided those pins into three groups: data,
 control, and status.
 The data group consists of 8 output pins, the control group consists of
 4 pins, and the status group consists of 5 input pins.
\layout Standard

In the early 1990's, the bidirectional parallel port was introduced, which
 allows the data group to be used for output or input.
 The HAL driver supports the bidirectional port, and allows the user to
 set the data group as either input or output.
 If configured as output, a port provides a total of 12 outputs and 5 inputs.
 If configured as input, it provides 4 outputs and 13 inputs.
 
\layout Standard

In some parallel ports, the control group pins are open collectors, which
 may also be driven low by an external gate.
 On a board with open collector control pins, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 mode allows a more flexible mode with 8 dedicated outputs, 5 dedicated
 inputs, and 4 open collector pins.
 In other parallel ports, the control group has push-pull drivers and cannot
 be used as an input.
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

HAL cannot automatically determine if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 mode bidirectional pins are actually open collectors (OC).
 If they are not, they cannot be used as inputs, and attempting to drive
 them LOW from an external source can damage the hardware.
\layout Standard

To determine whether your port has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

open collector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 pins, load hal_parport in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 mode, output a HIGH value on the pin.
 HAL should read the pin as TRUE.
 Next, insert a 470
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset 

 resistor from one of the control pins to GND.
 If the resulting voltage on the control pin is close to 0V, and HAL now
 reads the pin as FALSE, then you have an OC port.
 If the resulting voltage is far from 0V, or HAL does not read the pin as
 FALSE, then your port cannot be used in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 mode.
\layout Standard

The external hardware that drives the control pins should also use open
 collector gates (e.g., 74LS05).
 Generally, the -out HAL pins should be set to TRUE when the physical pin
 is being used as an input.
\layout Standard

On some machines, BIOS settings may affect whether

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 mode can be used.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SPP
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 mode is most most likely to work.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

No other combinations are supported, and a port cannot be changed from input
 to output once the driver is installed.
 Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:Parport-block-diag}

\end_inset 

 shows two block diagrams, one showing the driver when the data group is
 configured for output, and one showing it configured for input.
\layout Standard

The parport driver can control up to 8 ports (defined by MAX_PORTS in hal_parpor
t.c).
 The ports are numbered starting at zero.
\layout Subsection

Installing
\layout LyX-Code

loadrt hal_parport cfg="<config-string>"
\layout Standard

The config string consists of a hex port address, followed by an optional
 direction, repeated for each port.
 The direction is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and determines the direction of the physical pins 2 through 9, and whether
 to create input HAL pins for the physical control pins.
 If the direction is not specified, the data group defaults to output.
 For example:
\layout LyX-Code

loadrt hal_parport cfg="0x278 0x378 in 0x20A0 out"
\layout Standard

This example installs drivers for one port at 0x0278, with pins 2-9 as outputs
 (by default, since neither 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 nor 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 was specified), one at 0x0378, with pins 2-9 as inputs, and one at 0x20A0,
 with pins 2-9 explicitly specified as outputs.
 Note that you must know the base address of the parallel port to properly
 configure the driver.
 For ISA bus ports, this is usually not a problem, since the port is almost
 always at a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

well known
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 address, like 0278 or 0378 which is typically configured in the system
 BIOS.
 The address for a PCI card is usally shown in

\layout Standard

For each physical output pin, the driver creates a single HAL pin, for example
 
\family typewriter 
parport.0.pin-14-out
\family default 
.
 Pins 2 through 9 are part of the data group and are output pins if the
 port is defined as an output port.
 (Output is the default.) Pins 1, 14, 16, and 17 are outputs in all modes.
 These HAL pins control the state of the corresponding physical pins.
\layout Standard

For each physical input pin, the driver creates two HAL pins, for example
 
\family typewriter 
parport.0.pin-12-in
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
parport.0.pin-12-in-not
\family default 
.
 Pins 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 are always input pins.
 Pins 2 through 9 are input pins only if the port is defined as an input
 port.
 The 
\family typewriter 
-in
\family default 
 HAL pin is TRUE if the physical pin is high, and FALSE if the physical
 pin is low.
 The

 which sets groups of pins as inputs and outputs.
 The first two character set the direction of the first two 8 bit blocks
 of pins (0-7 and 8-15).
 The next two set blocks of 4 pins (16-19 and 20-23).
 The pattern then repeats, two more blocks of 8 bits (24-31 and 32-39) and

 It is an ISA card and it exists in different flavours (all supported by
 this driver).
 The board includes up to 8 channels of quadrature encoder input, 8 channels
 of analog input and output, 32 bits digital I/O, an interval timer with
 interrupt and a watchdog.
\layout Subsection

Installing:
\layout LyX-Code

loadrt hal_stg [base=<address>] [num_chan=<nr>] [dio="<dio-string>"] [model=<mod

\layout Standard

The base address field is optional; if it's not provided the driver attempts
 to autodetect the board.
 The num_chan field is used to specify the number of channels available
 on the card, if not used the 8 axis version is assumed.
 The digital inputs/outputs configuration is determined by a config string
 passed to insmod when loading the module.
 The format consists of a four character string that sets the direction
 of each group of pins.
 Each character of the direction string is either "I" or "O".
 The first character sets the direction of port A (Port A - DIO.0-7), the
 next sets port B (Port B - DIO.8-15), the next sets port C (Port C - DIO.16-23),
 and the fourth sets port D (Port D - DIO.24-31).
 The model field can be used in case the driver doesn't autodetect the right
 card version

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset 

 configuration, and this FPGA configurations is also provided with EMC2.
 It provides 8 encoder counters, 4 PWM outputs (normally used as DACs) and
 up to 48 digital I/O channels, 32 inputs and 16 outputs.

Ideally the encoders,

, and digital I/O would comply with the canonical interfaces defined earlier,
 but they don't.
 Fixing that is on the things-to-do list.

\layout Standard

If 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
loadFpga
\family default 
\series default 
 is 1 (the default) the driver will load the FPGA configuration on startup.
 If it is 0, the driver assumes the configuration is already loaded.
 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
dacRate
\family default 
\series default 
 sets the carrier frequency for the PWM outputs, in Hz.
 The default is 32000, for 32KHz PWM.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

I don't know what the maximum (and minimum, if any) PWM frequency is, it
 should be documented here.
 Also, this is the kind of thing that ideally is controlled by a HAL parameter,
 rather than being set when the driver is initially loaded.
 I don't know if that is possible, it depends on the hardware and I don't
 have the neccessary information.

 The driver prints some usefull debugging message to the kernel log, which
 can be viewed with

Pins
\layout Standard

In the following pins, parameters, and functions, <board> is the board ID.
 According to the naming conventions the first board should always have
 an ID of zero, however this driver uses the PCI board ID, so it may be
 non-zero even if there is only one board.

With normal 10 bit PWM, 50% duty cycle would be 512 cycles on and 512 cycles
 off = ca 30 kHz with 33 MHz reference counter.
 With fully interleaved PWM this would be 1 cycle on, 1 cycle off for 1024
 cycles (16.66 MHz if the PWM reference counter runs at 33 MHz) = much easier
 to filter.
 The 5I20 configuration interlace is somewhat between non and fully interlaced
 (to make it easy to filter but not have as many transistions as fully interleav
ed).

, the secondary encoders, enc-04, enc-05, enc-06, and enc-07 are wrongly
 configured.
 The input pins for enc-04 and enc-05 partly overlap, as do the pins for
 enc-06 and enc-07.
 Thus it is possible to use enc-04 and enc-06 simultaneously, but using
 enc-04 and enc-05 is not possible since counts on enc-04 will make the
 count on enc-05 jump by +/- 1.
 If you are using pins in-00 to in-11 as general purpose inputs you are
 not affected by this bug.

The index mask masks the index input of the encoder so that the encoder
 index can be combined with a mechanical switch or opto detector to clear
 or latch the encoder counter only when the mask input bit is in proper
 state (selected by mask polarity bit) and encoder index occurs.
 This is useful for homing.
 The behaviour of these pins is controlled by the Counter Control Register
 (CCR), however there is currently no function in the driver to change the
 CCR.

Vital Systems Motenc-100 and Motenc-LITE
\layout Standard

The Vital Systems Motenc-100 and Motenc-LITE are 8- and 4-channel servo
 control boards.
 The Motenc-100 provides 8 quadrature encoder counters, 8 analog inputs,
 8 analog outputs, 64 (68?) digital inputs, and 32 digital outputs.
 The Motenc-LITE has only 4 encoder counters, 32 digital inputs and 16 digital
 outputs, but it still has 8 analog inputs and 8 analog outputs.
 The driver automatically identifies the installed board and exports the
 appropriate HAL objects.
\begin_inset Foot

Ideally the encoders, DACs, ADCs, and digital I/O would comply with the
 canonical interfaces defined earlier, but they don't.
 Fixing that is on the things-to-do list.

In the following pins, parameters, and functions, <board> is the board ID.
 According to the naming conventions the first board should always have

Pico Systems PPMC (Parallel Port Motion Control)
\layout Standard

Pico Systems has a family of boards for doing servo, stepper, and pwm control.
 The boards connect to the PC through a parallel port working in EPP mode.
 Although most users connect one board to a parallel port, in theory any
 mix of up to 8 or 16 boards can be used on a single parport.
 One driver serves all types of boards.
 The final mix of I/O depends on the connected board(s).
 The driver doesn't distinguish between boards, it simply numbers I/O channels
 (encoders, etc) starting from 0 on the first card.
\layout Standard

Installing:
\layout LyX-Code

\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 
\series bold

\family default 
\series default 
 parameter tells the driver what parallel port(s) to check.
 By default, 
\family typewriter 
\series bold

\family default 
\series default 
 is 0x0378, and 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
<addr2>

 and following are not used.
 The driver searches the entire address space of the enhanced parallel port(s)
 at 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
port_addr
\family default 
\series default 
, looking for any board(s) in the PPMC family.
 It then exports HAL pins for whatever it finds.
 During loading (or attempted loading) the driver prints some usefull debugging
 message to the kernel log, which can be viewed with 
\family typewriter 
\series bold

\layout Standard

The Pluto
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Pluto}

\end_inset 

-P is an inexpensive ($60) FPGA board featuring the ACEX1K
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{ACEX1K}

\end_inset 

 chip from Altera.
 Pluto_servo is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License
 version 2.
 The pluto_servo system is suitable for control of a 4-axis CNC mill with
 servo motors, a 3-axis mill with PWM spindle control, a lathe with spindle
 encoder, etc.
 The large number of inputs allows a full set of limit switches.
\layout Standard

The board features:
\layout Itemize

4 quadrature channels with 40MHz sample rate.
 The counters operate in "4x" mode.
 The maximum useful quadrature rate is 8191 counts per emc2 servo cycle,
 or about 8MHz for EMC2's default 1ms servo rate.
 An axis with index pulse must have fewer than 8192 counts per revolution.
\layout Itemize

4 PWM channels, "up/down" or "pwm+dir" style.
 4095 duty cycles from -100% to +100%, including 0%.
 The PWM period is approximately 19.5kHz (40MHz / 2047).
 A PDM-like mode is also available.
 
\layout Itemize

18 digital outputs: 10 dedicated, 8 shared with PWM functions.
 (Example: A lathe with unidirectional PWM spindle control may use 13 total
 digital outputs) 
\layout Itemize

20 digital inputs: 8 dedicated, 12 shared with Quadrature functions.
 (Example: A lathe with index pulse only on the spindle may use 13 total
 digital inputs) 
\layout Itemize

EPP communication with the PC.
 The EPP communication typically takes around 100uS on machines tested so
 far, enabling servo rates above 1kHz.

Connectors
\layout Itemize

The Pluto-P board is shipped with the left connector presoldered, with the
 key in the indicated position.
 The other connectors are unpopulated.
 There does not seem to be a standard 12-pin IDC connector, but some of
 the pins of a 16P connector can hang off the board next to QA3/QZ3.
\layout Itemize

The bottom and right connectors are on the same .1" grid, but the left connector
 is not.
 If OUT2\SpecialChar \ldots{}
OUT9 are not required, a single IDC connector can span the bottom
 connector and the bottom two rows of the right connector.
 
\layout Subsection

Physical Pins
\layout Itemize

Read the ACEX1K datasheet for information about input and output voltage
 thresholds.
 The pins are all configured in "LVTTL/LVCMOS" mode and are generally compatible
 with 5V TTL logic.
\layout Itemize

Before configuration and after properly exiting emc2, all Pluto-P pins are
 tristated with weak pull-ups (20k
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset 

 min, 50k
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset 

 max).
 However, software bugs in the pluto_servo firmware or emc2, or a crash
 of the computer where emc2 is running, can leave the Pluto-P pins in an
 undefined state.
\layout Itemize

In pwm+dir mode, by default dir is HIGH for negative values and LOW for
 positive values.
 To select HIGH for positive values and LOW for negative values, set the
 corresponding dout-NN-invert parameter TRUE to invert the signal.
\layout Itemize

The index input is triggered on the rising edge.
 Initial testing has shown that the QZx inputs are particularly noise sensitive,
 due to being polled every 25ns.
 Digital filtering has been added to filter pulses shorter than 150ns (six
 polling times).
 Additional external filtering, such as a Schmitt buffer or inverter, RC
 filter, or differential receiver (if applicable) is recommended.
\layout Itemize

The IN1\SpecialChar \ldots{}
IN7 pins have 22-ohm series resistors to their associated FPGA pins.
 No other pins have any sort of protection for out-of-spec voltages or currents.
 It is up to the integrator to add appropriate isolation and protection.
 Traditional parallel port optoisolator boards do not work with pluto_servo
 due to the bidirectional nature of the EPP protocol.
 
\layout Subsection

LED
\layout Itemize

When the device is unprogrammed, the LED glows faintly.
 When the device is programmed, the LED glows according to the duty cycle
 of PWM0 (

).
\layout Subsection

Power
\layout Itemize

A small amount of current may be drawn from VCC.
 The available current depends on the unregulated DC input to the board.
 Alternately, regulated +3.3VDC may be supplied to the FPGA through these
 VCC pins.
 The required current is not yet known, but is probably around 50mA plus
 I/O current.
\layout Itemize

The regulator on the Pluto-P board is a low-dropout type.
 Supplying 5V at the power jack will allow the regulator to work properly.
\layout Subsection

PC interface
\layout Itemize

At present, only a single pluto_servo board is supported.
 At present there is no provision for multiple boards on one parallel port
 (because all boards reside at the same EPP address) but supporting one
 board per parallel port should be possible.
\layout Subsection

Input latching and output updating
\layout Itemize

PWM duty cycles for each channel are updated at different times.
\layout Itemize

Digital outputs OUT0 through OUT9 are all updated at the same time.
 Digital outputs OUT10 through OUT17 are updated at the same time as the
 pwm function they are shared with.
\layout Itemize

Digital inputs IN0 through IN19 are all latched at the same time.
\layout Itemize

Quadrature positions for each channel are latched at different times.
 
\layout Subsection

Rebuilding the FPGA firmware
\layout Standard

The src/hal/drivers/pluto_servo_firmware/ subdirectory contains the Verilog
 source code plus additional files used by Quartus for the FPGA firmware.
 Altera's Quartus II software is required to rebuild the FPGA firmware.
 To rebuild the firmware from the .hdl and other source files, open pluto_servo.qp
f and press CTRL-L.
 Then, recompile emc2.
\layout Standard

Like the HAL hardware driver, the FPGA firmware is licensed under the terms
 of the GNU General Public License.
\layout Standard

The gratis version of Quartus II runs only on Microsoft Windows, although
 there is apparently a paid version that runs on Linux.

The Pluto-P board may be ordered from 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl{http://www.knjn.com/ShopBoards_Parallel.html}

 (US based, international shipping is available).
 Some additional information about it is available from

 The L298 H-Bridge (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[L298 H-bridge]{http://www.st.com/stonline/books/pdf/docs/1773.pdf}

\end_inset 

) is inexpensive and can easily be used for motors up to 4A (one motor per
 L298) or up to 2A (two motors per L298) with the supply voltage up to 46V.
 However, the L298 does not have built-in current limiting, a problem for
 motors with high stall currents.
 For higher currents and voltages, some users have reported success with
 International Rectifier's integrated high-side/low-side drivers.
