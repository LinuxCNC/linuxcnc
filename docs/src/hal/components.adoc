= HAL Component List((("HAL Component List")))

== Components

// < explanation of the difference between a realtime and a non-realtime component >

Most of the commands in the following list have their own dedicated man pages.
Some will have expanded descriptions, some will have limited descriptions.
From this list you know what components exist, and you can use `man` _name_ on your UNIX command line to get additional information.
To view the information in the man page, in a terminal window type:

----
man axis
----

The one or other setup of a UNIX system may require to explicitly specify the section of the man page.
If you do not find the man page or the name of the man page is already taken by another UNIX tool with the LinuxCNC man page residing in another section,
then try to explicitly specify the section, as in `man _sectionno_ axis`, with _sectionno_ = 1 for non-realtime and 9 for realtime components.

[NOTE]
See also the 'Man Pages' section of the link:../index.html[docs main page] or the link:../man/[directory listing].
To search in the man pages, use the UNIX tool `apropos`.
