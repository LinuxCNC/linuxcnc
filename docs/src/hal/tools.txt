== [[sec:Halcmd]]Halcmd

Halcmd is a command line tool for manipulating the HAL. There is a
rather complete man page for halcmd, which will be installed if you
have installed EMC2 from either source or a package. If you have
compiled EMC2 for “run-in-place”, the man page is not installed, but it
is accessible. From the main EMC2 directory, do:

    `$ *man -M docs/man halcmd*`

Chapter  <<cha:HAL-Tutorial>> has a number of examples of halcmd
usage, and is a good tutorial for halcmd.

== Halmeter[[Halmeter]](((Halmeter)))

Halmeter is a “voltmeter” for the HAL. It lets you look at a pin,
signal, or parameter, and displays the current value of that item. It
is pretty simple to use. Start it by typing “`halmeter` ” in a X
windows shell. Halmeter is a GUI application. It will pop up
a small window, with two buttons labeled “Select” and “Exit”. Exit is
easy - it shuts down the program. Select pops up a larger window, with
three tabs. One tab lists all the pins currently defined in the HAL.
The next lists all the signals, and the last tab lists all the
parameters. Click on a tab, then click on a pin/signal/parameter. Then
click on “OK”. The lists will disappear, and the small window will
display the name and value of the selected item. The display is updated
approximately 10 times per second. If you click “Accept” instead of
“OK”, the small window will display the name and value of the selected
item, but the large window will remain on the screen. This is
convenient if you want to look at a number of different items quickly.

You can have many halmeters running at the same time, if you want to
monitor several items. If you want to launch a halmeter without tying
up a shell window, type `halmeter &` to run it in the background.
You can also make halmeter start 
displaying a specific item immediately, by adding “`pin|sig|par[am]
<name>` ” to the command line. It will display the pin, signal, or
parameter 
<name> as soon as it starts. (If there is no such item, it will simply
start normally.) And finally, if you specify an item to display, you
can add “-s” before the pin|sig|param to tell halmeter to use a small
window. The item name will be displayed in the title bar instead of
under the value, and there will be no buttons. Useful when you want a
lot of meters in a small amount of screen space.

Refer to section <<sec:Tutorial-halscope>> for more information. 

== Halscope[[sec:Halscope]]

Halscope is an “oscilloscope” for the HAL. It lets you capture the
value of pins, signals, and parameters as a function of time. Complete
operating instructions should be located here eventually. For now,
refer to section  <<sec:Tutorial-Halscope>> in the tutorial chapter,
which explains the basics.
