=  'comp': a tool for creating HAL modules

== Introduction

Writing a HAL component can be a tedious process, most of it in setup
calls to `rtapi_` and `hal_` functions and associated error checking.
'comp' will write all this code for you, automatically.

Compiling a HAL component is also much easier when using 'comp',
whether the component is part of the emc2 source tree, or outside it.

For instance, the "ddt" portion of `blocks`  is around 80 lines of
code. The equivalent component is very short
when written using the 'comp' preprocessor:

    component ddt "Compute the derivative of the input function";

and it can be compiled and installed very easily: by simply placing
`ddt.comp` in `src/hal/components` and running` "make`", or by placing
it anywhere on the system and running `comp --install ddt.comp`

== Definitions

component::
     A component is a single real-time module, which is loaded with `halcmd
    loadrt`. One `.comp` file specifies one component.

instance::
     A component can have zero or more instances. Each instance of a
    component is created equal (they all have the same pins, parameters,
    functions, and data) but behave independently when their pins,
    parameters, and data have different values.

singleton::
     It is possible for a component to be a "singleton", in which case
    exactly one instance is created. It seldom makes sense to write a
    `singleton`  component, unless there can literally only be a single
    object of that
    kind in the system (for instance, a component whose purpose is to
    provide a pin with the current UNIX time, or a hardware driver for the
    internal PC speaker)

== Instance creation

For a singleton, the one instance is created when the component is
loaded.

For a non-singleton, the `"count`" module parameter determines how
many numbered instances are created.

== Parameters

Comp's are passed the `"period"`  parameter which is the time in
nanoseconds of the last period to
execute the comp. This can be useful in comps that need the timing
information.

== Syntax

A `.comp` file consists of a number of declarations, followed by `;;` 
on a line of its own, followed by C code implementing the module's
functions.

Declarations include:

 - `component` `HALNAME` `(DOC``);`
 -  `pin` `PINDIRECTION` `TYPE` `HALNAME` `([``SIZE``]|[``MAXSIZE` `:`
   `CONDSIZE]``) (if` `CONDITION``) (=` `STARTVALUE``) (``DOC``);`
 -  `param` `PARAMDIRECTION` `TYPE` `HALNAME` `([``SIZE``]|[``MAXSIZE` `:`
   `CONDSIZE]``) (if` `CONDITION)` `(=` `STARTVALUE``) (``DOC``) ;`
 - `function` `HALNAME` `(fp | nofp) (``DOC``);`
 - `option` `OPT` `(``VALUE``);`
 - `variable` `CTYPE NAME` `([``SIZE``]);`
 - `description` `DOC``;`
 - `see_also` `DOC``;`
 - `license` `LICENSE``;`
 - `author` `AUTHOR``;`

Parentheses indicate optional items. A vertical bar indicates
alternatives. Words in 'CAPITALS' indicate variable text, as follows:

HALNAME::
    An identifier.
    When used to create a HAL identifier, any underscores are replaced
    with dashes, and any trailing dash or period is removed, so that
    "this_name_" will be turned into "this-name", and if the name is "`_`",
    then a trailing period is removed as well, so that "`function _`" gives
    a HAL function name like `component.<num>` instead of
    `component.<num>.`
    
    If present, the prefix `hal_`  is removed from the beginning of the
    component name when creating
    pins, parameters and functions.
    
    In the HAL identifier for a pin or parameter, # denotes an array item,
    and must be used in conjunction with a `[SIZE]`  declaration. The hash
    marks are replaced with a 0-padded number with
    the same length as the number of # characters.
    
    When used to create a C identifier, the following changes are applied
    to the HALNAME:
    
     .  Any # characters, and any ".", "_" or "-" characters immediately
       before them, are removed.
     . Any remaining "." and "-" characters are replaced with "_"
     . Repeated "_" characters are changed to a single "_" character.
    
    A trailing _ is retained, so that HAL identifiers which would
    otherwise collide with reserved names or keywords (e.g., 'min') can be
    used.

|========================================
|HALNAME | C Identifier | HAL Identifier
|x_y_z | x_y_z | x-y-z
|x-y.z | x_y_z | x-y.z
|x_y_z_ | x_y_z_ | x-y-z
|x.##.y | x_y(MM) | x.MM.z
|x.## | x(MM) | x.MM
|========================================

if CONDITION::
     An expression involving the variable 'personality' which is nonzero
    when the pin or parameter should be created

SIZE::
     A number that gives the size of an array. The array items are numbered
    from 0 to 'SIZE'-1.

MAXSIZE : CONDSIZE::
     A number that gives the maximum size of the array followed by an
    expression involving the variable 'personality' and which always
    evaluates to less than 'MAXSIZE'. When the array is created its size
    will be 'CONDSIZE'.

DOC::
     A string that documents the item. String can be a C-style "double
    quoted" string, like `"Selects the desired edge: TRUE means falling,
    FALSE means rising"`  or a Python-style "triple quoted" string, which
    may include embedded
    newlines and quote characters, such as: 
        `param rw bit zot=TRUE` 
        `"""The effect of this parameter, also known as "the orb of zot",` 
        `will require at least two paragraphs to explain.` 
         
        `Hopefully these paragraphs have allowed you to understand "zot"` 
        `better.""";`
    
    The documentation string is in "groff -man" format. For more
    information on this markup format, see `groff_man(7)` . Remember that
    comp interprets backslash escapes in strings, so for
     instance to set the italic font for the word 'example', write
    `"\\fIexample\\fB"`.

TYPE::
     One of the HAL types: `bit`, `signed`, `unsigned`, or `float`. The old
    names `s32` and `u32` may also be used, but `signed` and `unsigned` are
    preferred.

PINDIRECTION::
     One of the following: `in`, `out`, or `io`. A component sets a value
    for an `out` pin, it reads a value from an `in` pin, and it may read or
    set the value of an `io` pin.

PARAMDIRECTION::
     One of the following: `r` or `rw`. A component sets a value for a `r`
    parameter, and it may read or set the value of a `rw` parameter.

STARTVALUE::
     Specifies the initial value of a pin or parameter. If it is not
    specified, then the default is `0` or `FALSE`, depending on the type of
    the item.

fp::
    Indicates that the function performs floating-point calculations.

nofp::
     Indicates that it only performs integer calculations. If neither is
    specified, `fp`  is assumed. Neither comp nor gcc can detect the use of
    floating-point
    calculations in functions that are tagged `nofp`.

OPT, VALUE::
     Depending on the option name OPT, the valid VALUEs vary. The currently
    defined options are:
    option singleton yes;;
        (default: no)
        Do not create a `count` module parameter, and always create a single
         instance. With `singleton`, items are named
    `component-name.item-name`
        and without `singleton`, items for numbered instances are named
        `component-name.<num>.item-name`.
    
    option default_count ;;
        'number' (default: 1)
        Normally, the module parameter `count` defaults to 0. If specified,
        the `count` will default to this value instead.
    
    option count_function yes;;
        (default: no)
         Normally, the number of instances to create is specified in the
    module
         parameter `count`; if `count_function` is specified, the value
    returned
         by the function `int get_count(void)` is used instead, and the
    `count`
        module parameter is not defined.
    
    option rtapi_app no;;
        (default: yes)
        Normally, the functions `rtapi_app_main` and `rtapi_app_exit` are
        automatically defined. With `option rtapi_app no`, they are not, and
        must be provided in the C code.
        
        When implementing your own `rtapi_app_main`, call the function `int
         export(char *prefix, long extra_arg)` to register the pins,
    parameters,
        and functions for `prefix`.
    
    option data ;;
        'type' (default: none) deprecated
        If specified, each instance of the component will have an associated
        data block of 'type' (which can be a simple type like `float` or the
        name of a type created with `typedef`).
        
        In new components, 'variable' should be used instead.

option extra_setup yes::
    (default: no)
    If specified, call the function defined by `EXTRA_SETUP` for each
    instance. If using the automatically defined `rtapi_app_main`,
    `extra_arg` is the number of this instance.
    
    option extra_cleanup yes;;
        (default: no)
        If specified, call the function defined by `EXTRA_CLEANUP` from the
         automatically defined `rtapi_app_exit`, or if an error is detected
    in
        the automatically defined `rtapi_app_main`.
    
    option userspace yes;;
        (default: no)
         If specified, this file describes a userspace component, rather
    than a
         real one. A userspace component may not have functions defined by
    the
        `function`  directive. Instead, after all the instances are
        constructed, the C
          function `user_mainloop()` is called. When this function returns,
    the
        component exits. Typically, `user_mainloop()` will use
         `FOR_ALL_INSTS()`  to perform the update action for each instance,
    then
        sleep for a
          short time. Another common action in `user_mainloop()` may be to
    call
        the event handler loop of a GUI toolkit.
    
    option userinit yes;;
        (default: no)
        If specified, the function `userinit(argc,argv)` is called before
        `rtapi_app_main()` (and thus before the call to `hal_init()` ). This
        function may process the commandline arguments or take other
          actions. Its return type is `void`; it may call `exit()`  if it
    wishes
        to terminate rather than create a hal component (for
        instance, because the commandline arguments were invalid).
    
    If an option's VALUE is not specified, then it is equivalent to
    specifying `option … yes` . The result of assigning an inappropriate
    value to an option is
    undefined. The result of using any other option is undefined.

LICENSE::
     Specify the license of the module for the documentation and for the
    MODULE_LICENSE() module declaration. For example, to specify that the
    module's license is GPL,
        license "GPL";
    
    For additional information on the meaning of MODULE_LICENSE() and
    additional license identifiers, see `<linux/module.h>`.
    
    Starting in emc 2.3, this declaration is required.

AUTHOR::
    Specify the author of the module for the documentation.

C++-style one-line comments (`// …`) and C-style multi-line comments
(`/* … */`) are both supported in the declaration section.

== Per-instance data storage

variable ::
    'CTYPE NAME';

variable ::
    'CTYPE NAME'['SIZE'];

variable ::
    'CTYPE NAME' = 'DEFAULT';

variable ::
    'CTYPE NAME'['SIZE'] = 'DEFAULT';
    Declare a per-instance variable 'NAME' of type 'CTYPE', optionally as
    an array of 'SIZE' items, and optionally with a default value
    'DEFAULT'. Items with no 'DEFAULT' are initialized to all-bits-zero.
    'CTYPE' is a simple one-word C type, such as `float`, `u32`, `s32`,
    int, etc. 
    Access to array variables uses square brackets.


== Other restrictions on comp files

Though HAL permits a pin, a parameter, and a function to have the same
name, comp does not.

== Convenience Macros

Based on the items in the declaration section, 'comp' creates a C
structure called `struct state`. However, instead of referring to the
members of this structure (e.g., `*(inst->name)` ), they will generally
be referred to using the macros below. The
 details of `struct state` and these macros may change from one version
of 'comp' to the next.

FUNCTION(name)::
     Use this macro to begin the definition of a realtime function which
    was previously declared with `"function NAME`". The function includes a
    parameter `"period` " which is the integer number of nanoseconds
    between calls to the
    function.

EXTRA_SETUP()::
     Use this macro to begin the definition of the function called to
    perform extra setup of this instance. Return a negative Unix `errno`
    value to indicate failure (e.g., `return -EBUSY` on failure to reserve
    an I/O port), or 0 to indicate success.

EXTRA_CLEANUP()::
     Use this macro to begin the definition of the function called to
    perform extra cleanup of the component. Note that this function must
    clean up all instances of the component, not just one. The "pin_name",
    "parameter_name", and "data" macros may not be used here.

pin_name::
    

parameter_name::
      For each pin `pin_name` or param `parameter_name`  there is a macro
    which allows the name to be used on its own to refer
    to the pin or parameter.
    When `pin_name` or `parameter_name` is an array, the macro is of the
    form 'pin_name(idx)' or 'param_name(idx)' where 'idx'  is the index
    into the pin array. When the array is a variable-sized
    array, it is only legal to refer to items up to its 'condsize'.
    
    When the item is a conditional item, it is only legal to refer to it
    when its 'condition' evaluated to a nonzero value.

variable_name::
      For each variable `variable_name`  there is a macro which allows the
    name to be used on its own to refer
     to the variable. When `variable_name` is an array, the normal C-style
    subscript is used: 'variable_name[idx]'

data::
     If "option data" is specified, this macro allows access to the
    instance data.

fperiod::
     The floating-point number of seconds between calls to this realtime
    function.

FOR_ALL_INSTS() {::
     `…`} For userspace components. This macro uses the variable `struct
    state *inst`  to iterate over all the defined instances. Inside the
    body of the
     loop, the 'pin_name', 'parameter_name', and *data* macros work as they
    do in realtime functions.

== Components with one function

If a component has only one function and the string "FUNCTION" does
not appear anywhere after `;;`, then the portion after `;;` is all
taken to be the body of the component's single function.

== Component Personality

If a component has any pins or parameters with an "if 'condition'" or
"['maxsize : condsize']", it is called a component with "'personality'
". The "personality" of each instance is specified when the module is
loaded. "Personality" can be used to create pins only when needed. For
 instance, personality is used in the `logic`  component, to allow for
a variable number of input pins to each logic
gate and to allow for a selection of any of the basic boolean logic
functions *and*, *or*, and *xor*.

== Compiling  `.comp` files in the source tree

Place the `.comp` file in the source directory
`emc2/src/hal/components` and re-run `make`. `Comp` files are
automatically detected by the build system.

If a `.comp` file is a driver for hardware, it may be placed in
`emc2/src/hal/components`  and will be built except if emc2 is
configured as a userspace
simulator.

== Compiling realtime components outside the source tree [[sec:Compiling-realtime-components]]

`comp`  can process, compile, and install a realtime component in a
single
step, placing `rtexample.ko` in the emc2 realtime module directory:

    comp --install rtexample.comp

Or, it can process and compile in one step, leaving `example.ko` (or
`example.so` for the simulator) in the current directory:

    comp --compile rtexample.comp

Or it can simply process, leaving `example.c` in the current directory:

    comp rtexample.comp

`comp` can also compile and install a component written in C, using
the `--install` and `--compile` options shown above:

    comp --install rtexample2.c

man-format documentation can also be created from the information in
the declaration section:

    comp --document rtexample.comp

The resulting manpage, `example.9` can be viewed with

    man ./example.9

or copied to a standard location for manual pages.

== Compiling userspace components outside the source tree

`comp` can process, compile, install, and document userspace components:

    comp usrexample.comp

This only works for `.comp` files, not for `.c` files.

== Examples

=== constant

This component functions like the one in "blocks", including the
default value of 1.0. The declaration "function _" creates functions
named "constant.0", etc.

    component constant;

=== sincos

This component computes the sine and cosine of an input angle in
radians. It has different capabilities than the "sine" and "cosine"
outputs of siggen, because the input is an angle, rather than running
freely based on a "frequency" parameter.

The pins are declared with the names `sin_` and `cos_` in the source
code so that they do not interfere with the functions `sin()` and
`cos()`. The HAL pins are still called `sincos.<num>.sin`.

    component sincos;

=== out8

This component is a driver for a 'fictional'  card called "out8",
which has 8 pins of digital output which are
treated as a single 8-bit value. There can be a varying number of such
cards in the system, and they can be at various addresses. The pin is
 called `out_` because `out` is an identifier used in `<asm/io.h>`. It
illustrates the use of `EXTRA_SETUP` and `EXTRA_CLEANUP`  to request an
I/O region and then free it in case of error or when
the module is unloaded.

    component out8;
    pin out unsigned out_ "Output value; only low 8 bits are used";
    param r unsigned ioaddr;
    
    function _;
    
    option count_function;
    option extra_setup;
    option extra_cleanup;
    option constructable no;
    
    license "GPL";
    ;;
    #include <asm/io.h>
    
    #define MAX 8 int io[MAX] = {0,};
    RTAPI_MP_ARRAY_INT(io, MAX, "I/O addresses of out8 boards");
    
    int get_count(void) {
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0; i<MAX && io[i]; i++) { /* Nothing */ }
        return i;
    }
    
    EXTRA_SETUP() {
        if(!rtapi_request_region(io[extra_arg], 1, "out8")) {
        // set this I/O port to 0 so that EXTRA_CLEANUP does not release the IO
        // ports that were never requested.
            io[extra_arg] = 0;
            return -EBUSY;
        }
        ioaddr = io[extra_arg];
        return 0; }
    
    EXTRA_CLEANUP() {
        int i;
        for(i=0; i < MAX && io[i]; i++) {
            rtapi_release_region(io[i], 1);
        }
    }
    
    FUNCTION(_) { outb(out_, ioaddr); }

=== hal_loop

    component hal_loop;

This fragment of a component illustrates the use of the `hal_` prefix
in a component name. `loop` is the name of a standard Linux kernel
module, so a `loop` component might not successfully load if the Linux
`loop` module was also present on the system.

When loaded, `halcmd show comp` will show a component called
`hal_loop`. However, the pin shown by `halcmd show pin` will be
`loop.0.example`, not `hal-loop.0.example`.

=== arraydemo

This realtime component illustrates use of fixed-size arrays:

    component arraydemo "4-bit Shift register";

=== rand

This userspace component changes the value on its output pin to a new
random value in the range latexmath:[[0,1)] about once every 1ms.


----------------------------------------
component rand;
option userspace;

pin out float out;
license "GPL";

    while(1) {
        usleep(1000);
        FOR_ALL_INSTS() out = drand48();
    }
}


----------------------------------------

=== logic

This realtime component shows how to use "personality" to create
variable-size arrays and optional pins.


----------------------------------------
component logic "EMC2 HAL component providing experimental logic functions";
pin in bit in-##[16 : personality & 0xff];

    if(personality & 0x100) and = a;
    if(personality & 0x200) or = o;

}

----------------------------------------

A typical load line for this component might be

    loadrt logic count=3 personality=0x102,0x305,0x503

which creates the following pins:

 - A 2-input AND gate: logic.0.and, logic.0.in-00, logic.0.in-01
 -  5-input AND and OR gates: logic.1.and, logic.1.or, logic.1.in-00,
   logic.1.in-01, logic.1.in-02, logic.1.in-03, logic.1.in-04, 
 -  3-input AND and XOR gates: logic.2.and, logic.2.xor, logic.2.in-00,
   logic.2.in-01, logic.2.in-02
