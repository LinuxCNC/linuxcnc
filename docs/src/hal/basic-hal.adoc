This document provides a reference to the basics of HAL.

[[sec:hal-commands]]
== HAL Commands(((HAL Commands)))

More detailed information can be found in the man page for halcmd: run 'man halcmd' in a terminal window.

To see the HAL configuration and check the status of pins and parameters use the HAL Configuration window on the Machine menu in AXIS.
To watch a pin status open the Watch tab and click on each pin you wish to watch and it will be added to the watch window.

[[sub:hal-loart]]
=== loadrt(((HAL loadrt,loadrt)))

The command `loadrt` loads a real time HAL component.
Real time component functions need to be added to a thread to be updated at the rate of the thread.
You cannot load a non-realtime component into the realtime space.

.loadrt Syntax and Example
[source,{hal}]
----
loadrt <component> <options>
loadrt mux4 count=1
----

[[sub:hal-addf]]
=== addf(((HAL addf,addf)))

The `addf` command adds a function to a real-time thread.
If the StepConf wizard was used to create the configuration, two threads have been created (``base-thread`` and ``servo-thread``).

`addf` adds function _functname_ to thread _threadname_.
Default is to add the function in the order they are in the file.
If _position_ is specified, adds the function to that spot in the thread.
A negative _position_ indicates the position with respect to the end of the thread.
For example '1' is start of thread, '-1' is the end of the thread, '-3' is third from the end.

For some functions it is important to load them in a certain order, like the parport read and write functions.
The function name is usually the component name plus a number.
In the following example the component 'or2' is loaded and `show function` shows the name of the or2 function.

----
$ halrun
halcmd: loadrt or2
halcmd: show function
Exported Functions:
Owner   CodeAddr  Arg       FP   Users  Name
 00004  f8bc5000  f8f950c8  NO       0   or2.0
----

You have to add a function from a HAL real time component to a thread to get the function to update at the rate of the thread.
Usually there are two threads as shown in this example.
Some components use floating point math and must be added to a thread that supports floating point math.
The `FP` indicates if floating point math is supported in that thread.

----
$ halrun
halcmd: loadrt motmod base_period_nsec=55555 servo_period_nsec=1000000 num_joints=3
halcmd: show thread
Realtime Threads:
     Period  FP     Name               (     Time, Max-Time )
     995976  YES          servo-thread (        0,        0 )
      55332  NO            base-thread (        0,        0 )
----

- base-thread (the high-speed thread):
  This thread handles items that need a fast response, like making step pulses, and reading and writing the parallel port.
  Does not support floating point math.
- servo-thread (the slow-speed thread):
  This thread handles items that can tolerate a slower response, like the motion controller, ClassicLadder, and the motion command handler and supports floating point math.

.addf Syntax and Example
[source,{hal}]
----
addf <function> <thread>
addf mux4.0 servo-thread
----

[NOTE]
If the component requires a floating point thread that is usually the slower servo-thread.

[[sub:hal-loadusr]]
=== loadusr(((HAL loadusr,loadusr)))

The command `loadusr` loads a non-realtime HAL component.
Non-realtime programs are their own separate processes, which optionally talk to other HAL components via pins and parameters.
You cannot load realtime components into non-realtime space.

Flags may be one or more of the following:

[horizontal]
-W:: to wait for the component to become ready. The component is assumed to have the same name as the first argument of the command.

-Wn <name>:: to wait for the component, which will have the given <name>.  This only applies if the component has a name option.

-w:: to wait for the program to exit

-i:: to ignore the program return value (with -w)

-n:: name a component when it is a valid option for that component.

.Syntax and Examples of `loadusr`
[source,{hal}]
----
loadusr <component> <options>
loadusr halui
loadusr -Wn spindle gs2_vfd -n spindle
----

In English it means 'loadusr wait for name spindle component gs2_vfd name spindle'.

[[sub:hal-net]]
=== net(((HAL net,net)))

The command `net` creates a 'connection' between a signal and one or more pins.
If the signal does not exist net creates the new signal.
This replaces the need to use the command newsig.
The optional direction arrows `<=`, `=>` and `<=>` make it easier to follow the logic when reading a `net` command line and are not used by the net command.
The direction arrows must be separated by a space from the pin names.

.Syntax and Examples of `net`
[source,{hal}]
----
net signal-name pin-name <optional arrow> <optional second pin-name>
net home-x joint.0.home-sw-in <= parport.0.pin-11-in
----

In the above example `home-x` is the signal name, `joint.0.home-sw-in` is a 'Direction IN' pin, `<=` is the optional direction arrow, and `parport.0.pin-11-in` is a 'Direction OUT' pin.
This may seem confusing but the in and out labels for a parallel port pin indicates the physical way the pin works not how it is handled in HAL.

A pin can be connected to a signal if it obeys the following rules:

* An IN pin can always be connected to a signal.
* An IO pin can be connected unless there's an OUT pin on the signal.
* An OUT pin can be connected only if there are no other OUT or IO pins on the signal.

The same 'signal-name' can be used in multiple net commands to connect additional pins, as long as the rules above are obeyed.

[[cap:signal-direction]]
.Signal Direction
image::images/signal-direction.png["Signal Direction",align="center"]

This example shows the signal xStep with the source being `stepgen.0.out` and with two readers, `parport.0.pin-02-out` and `parport.0.pin-08-out`.
Basically the value of `stepgen.0.out` is sent to the signal xStep and that value is then sent to `parport.0.pin-02-out` and `parport.0.pin-08-out`.

[source,{hal}]
----
#   signal    source            destination          destination
net xStep stepgen.0.out => parport.0.pin-02-out parport.0.pin-08-out
----

Since the signal xStep contains the value of `stepgen.0.out` (the source) you can use the same signal again to send the value to another reader.
To do this just use the signal with the readers on another line.

[source,{hal}]
----
#   signal       destination2
net xStep => parport.0.pin-06-out
----

.I/O pins
An I/O pin like encoder._N_.index-enable can be read or set as allowed by the component.

[[sub:hal-setp]]
=== setp(((HAL setp,setp)))

The command `setp` sets the value of a pin or parameter.
The valid values will depend on the type of the pin or parameter.
It is an error if the data types do not match.

Some components have parameters that need to be set before use.
Parameters can be set before use or while running as needed.
You cannot use setp on a pin that is connected to a signal.

.Syntax and Examples of `setp`
[source,{hal}]
----
setp <pin/parameter-name> <value>
setp parport.0.pin-08-out TRUE
----

[[sub:hal-sets]]
=== sets(((HAL sets,sets)))

The command `sets` sets the value of a signal.

.Syntax and Examples of `sets`
[source,{hal}]
----
sets <signal-name> <value>
net mysignal and2.0.in0 pyvcp.my-led
sets mysignal 1
----

It is an error if:

* The signal-name does not exist
* If the signal already has a writer
* If value is not the correct type for the signal

[[sub:hal-inlinkp]]
=== unlinkp(((HAL unlinkp,unlinkp)))

The command `unlinkp` unlinks a pin from the connected signal.
If no signal was connected to the pin prior running the command, nothing happens.
The `unlinkp` command is useful for trouble shooting.

.Syntax and Examples of `unlinkp`
[source,{hal}]
----
unlinkp <pin-name>
unlinkp parport.0.pin-02-out
----

=== Obsolete Commands

The following commands are depreciated and may be removed from future versions.
Any new configuration should use the <<sub:hal-net,`net`>> command.
These commands are included so older configurations will still work.

==== linksp (deprecated)

The command `linksp` creates a 'connection' between a signal and one pin.

.Syntax and Examples of `linksp`
[source,{hal}]
----
linksp <signal-name> <pin-name>
linksp X-step parport.0.pin-02-out
----

*The `linksp` command has been superseded by the `net` command.*

==== linkps (deprecated)

The command `linkps` creates a 'connection' between one pin and one signal.
It is the same as `linksp` but the arguments are reversed.

.Syntax and Examples of `linkps`
[source,{hal}]
----
linkps <pin-name> <signal-name>
linkps parport.0.pin-02-out X-Step
----

*The `linkps` command has been superseded by the `net` command.*

==== newsig

the command `newsig` creates a new HAL signal by the name _<signame>_ and the data type of _<type>_.
Type must be 'bit', 's32', 'u32', 's64', 'u64' or 'float'. Error if _<signame>_ already exists.

.Syntax and Examples of `newsig`
[source,{hal}]
----
newsig <signame> <type>
newsig Xstep bit
----

More information can be found in the HAL manual or the man pages for `halrun`.

[[sec:hal-data]]
== HAL Data(((HAL Data)))

[[sub:hal-bit]]
=== Bit(((HAL Bit,bit)))

A bit value is an on or off.

- bit values = true or 1 and false or 0 (True, TRUE, true are all valid)

[[sub:hal-float]]
=== Float(((HAL Float,float)))

A 'float' is a floating point number.
In other words the decimal point can move as needed.

- float values = a 64 bit floating point value, with approximately 53 bits of resolution and over 2^10^ (~ 1000) bits of dynamic range.

For more information on floating point numbers see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point]

[[sub:hal-s32]]
=== s32(((HAL s32,s32)))

An 's32' number is a whole number that can have a negative or positive value.

- s32 values = integer numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647

[[sub:hal-u32]]
=== u32(((HAL u32,u32)))

A 'u32' number is a whole number that is positive only.

- u32 values = integer numbers from 0 to 4294967295

[[sub:hal-s64]]
=== s64(((HAL s64,s64)))

An 's64' number is a whole number that can have a negative or positive value.

- s64 values = integer numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to
  +9,223,372,036,854,775,807

[[sub:hal-u64]]
=== u64(((HAL u64,u64)))

A 'u64' number is a whole number that is positive only.

- u64 values = integer numbers from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

[[sec:hal-files]]
== HAL Files(((HAL Files)))

If you used the Stepper Config Wizard to generate your config you will have up to three HAL files in your config directory.

- 'my-mill.hal' (if your config is named 'my-mill') This file is loaded first and should not be changed if you used the Stepper Config Wizard.
- 'custom.hal' This file is loaded next and before the GUI loads.
  This is where you put your custom HAL commands that you want loaded before the GUI is loaded.
- 'custom_postgui.hal' This file is loaded after the GUI loads.
  This is where you put your custom HAL commands that you want loaded after the GUI is loaded.
  Any HAL commands that use PyVCP widgets need to be placed here.

[[sec:hal-parameters]]
== HAL Parameter(((HAL Parameters)))

Two parameters are automatically added to each HAL component when it is created.
These parameters allow you to scope the execution time of a component.

[horizontal]
`.time`(((HAL time))):: Time is the number of CPU cycles it took to execute the function.
`.tmax`(((HAL tmax))):: Tmax is the maximum number of CPU cycles it took to execute the function.

`tmax` is a read/write parameter so the user can set it to 0 to get rid of the first time initialization on the function's execution time.

[[sec:hal-logic-components]]
== Basic Logic Components(((HAL Logic Components)))

HAL contains several real time logic components.
Logic components follow a 'Truth Table' that states what the output is for any given input.
Typically these are bit manipulators and follow electrical logic gate truth tables.

For further components see <<sec:hal-components,HAL Components List>> or the man pages.

[[sub:hal-and2]]
=== and2(((HAL and2,and2)))

The `and2` component is a two input and-gate.
The truth table below shows the output based on each combination of input.

.Syntax

[[sec:hal-logic-examples]]
== Logic Examples(((HAL Logic Examples)))

.Example using `and2`
[source,{hal}]
----
loadrt and2 count=1
addf and2.0 servo-thread
net my-sigin1 and2.0.in0 <= parport.0.pin-11-in
net my-sigin2 and2.0.in1 <= parport.0.pin-12-in
net both-on parport.0.pin-14-out <= and2.0.out
----

In the above example one copy of `and2` is loaded into real time space and added to the servo thread.
Next `pin-11` of the parallel port is connected to the `in0` bit of the and gate.
Next `pin-12` is connected to the `in1` bit of the and gate.
Last we connect the `and2` out bit to the parallel port `pin-14`.
So following the truth table for `and2` if pin 11 and pin 12 are on then the output pin 14 will be on.

[[sec:hal-conversion-components]]
== Conversion Components(((HAL Conversion Components)))

[[sub:hal-weighted-sum]]
=== weighted_sum(((HAL weighted_sum,weighted_sum)))

The weighted sum converts a group of bits into an integer.
The conversion is the sum of the 'weights' of the bits present plus any offset.
It's similar to 'binary coded decimal' but with more options.
The 'hold' bit interrupts the input processing, so that the 'sum' value no longer changes.

.Syntax for loading component `weighted_sum`
[source,{hal}]
----
loadrt weighted_sum wsum_sizes=size[,size,...]
----

Creates groups of ``weighted_sum``s, each with the given number of input bits (size).

To update the `weighted_sum`, the `process_wsums` must be attached to a thread.

.Add `process_wsums` to servo thread
[source,{hal}]
----
addf process_wsums servo-thread
----

Which updates the `weighted_sum` component.

In the following example, a copy of the AXIS HAL configuration window, bits '0' and '2' are TRUE, they have no offset.
The weight ('weight') of bit 0 is 1, that of bit 2 is 4, so the sum is 5.
