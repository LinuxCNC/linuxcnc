= GS2 VFD Driver

[[cha:gs2-vfd-driver]] (((GS2 VFD Driver)))

This is a userspace HAL program for the GS2 series of VFD's at
Automation Direct.

This component is loaded using the halcmd "loadusr" command:
----
loadusr -Wn spindle-vfd gs2_vfd -n spindle-vfd 
----

The above command says: loadusr, wait for named to load, 
component gs2_vfd, named spindle-vfd

== Command Line Options

* -b or --bits <n> (default 8) Set number of data bits to <n>, where n
   must be from 5 to 8 inclusive 
* -d or --device <path> (default /dev/ttyS0) Set the name of the serial
   device node to use 
* -g or --debug Turn on debugging messages. This will also set the
   verbose flag. Debug mode will cause all modbus messages to be printed
   in hex on the terminal. 
* -n or --name <string> (default gs2_vfd) Set the name of the HAL
   module. The HAL comp name will be set to <string>, and all pin and
   parameter names will begin with <string>. 
* -p or --parity {even,odd,none} (default odd) Set serial parity to
   even, odd, or none. 
* -r or --rate <n> (default 38400) Set baud rate to <n>. It is an error
   if the rate is not one of the following: 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400,
   4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 
* -s or --stopbits {1,2} (default 1) Set serial stop bits to 1 or 2
* -t or --target <n> (default 1) Set MODBUS target (slave) number. This
   must match the device number you set on the GS2. 
* -v or --verbose Turn on debug messages.

[NOTE]
That if there are serial configuration errors, turning on verbose
may result in a flood of timeout errors.

== Pins

Where <n> is gs2_vfd or the name given during loading with the -n option.

* <n>.DC-bus-volts (float, out) The DC bus voltage of the VFD
* <n>.at-speed (bit, out) when drive is at commanded speed
* <n>.err-reset (bit, in) reset errors sent to VFD
* <n>.firmware-revision (s32, out) from the VFD
* <n>.frequency-command (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.frequency-out (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.is-stopped (bit, out) when the VFD reports 0 Hz output
* <n>.load-percentage (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.motor-RPM (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.output-current (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.output-voltage (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.power-factor (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.scale-frequency (float, out) from the VFD
* <n>.speed-command (float, in) speed sent to VFD in RPM 
    It is an error to send a speed faster than the Motor Max RPM as set in
   the VFD
* <n>.spindle-fwd (bit, in) 1 for FWD and 0 for REV sent to VFD
* <n>.spindle-rev (bit, in) 1 for REV and 0 if off
* <n>.spindle-on (bit, in) 1 for ON and 0 for OFF sent to VFD
* <n>.status-1 (s32, out) Drive Status of the VFD (see the GS2 manual)
* <n>.status-2 (s32, out) Drive Status of the VFD (see the GS2
   manual) 

[NOTE]
The status value is a sum of all the bits that are on. So a 163
which means the drive is in the run mode is the sum of 3 (run) + 32
(freq set by serial) + 128 (operation set by serial).

== Parameters

Where <n> is gs2_vfd or the name given during loading with the -n option.

* <n>.error-count (s32, RW) 
* <n>.loop-time (float, RW) how often the modbus is polled (default 0.1)
* <n>.nameplate-HZ (float, RW) Nameplate Hz of motor (default 60)
* <n>.nameplate-RPM (float, RW) Nameplate RPM of motor (default 1730)
* <n>.retval (s32, RW) the return value of an error in HAL
* <n>.tolerance (s32, RW) speed tolerance (default 0.01)
