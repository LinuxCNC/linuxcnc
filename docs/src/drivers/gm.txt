General Mechatronics GM6-PCI card based motion control system

For detailed description, please refer to the http://www.generalmechatronics.com/data/products/robot_controller/PCI_UserManual_eng.pdf[System integration manual].

The GM6-PCI motion control card is based on an FPGA and a PCI bridge 
interface ASIC. A small automated manufacturing cell can be controlled, 
with a short time system integration procedure. The following figure 
demonstrating the typical connection of devices related to the control 
system:

*  It can control up to six axis, each can be stepper or CAN bus 
   interface or analogue servo.
 
*  GPIO: Four time eight I/O pins are placed on standard flat cable headers.

*  RS485 I/O expander modules: RS485 bus was designed for interfacing 
   with compact DIN-rail mounted expander modules. An 8-channel digital input, 
   an 8-channel relay output and an analogue I/O (4x +/-10 Volts output and 8x 
   +/-5 Volts input) modules are available now. Up to 16 modules can be 
   connected to the bus altogether.
   
*  20 optically isolated input pins: Six times three for the direct 
   connection of two end switch and one homing sensor for each joint. And
   additionally, two optically isolated E-stop inputs.

=== Axis interface modules

Small sized DIN rail mounted interface modules gives easy way of connecting 
different types of servo modules to the axis connectors. 
Seven different system configurations are presented in the 
http://www.generalmechatronics.com/data/products/robot_controller/PCI_UserManual_eng.pdf[System integration manual] 
for evaluating typical applications. Also the detailed description of the 
Axis modules can be found in the System integration manual.

For evaluating the appropriate servo-drive structure the modules 
have to be connected as the following block diagram shows:

.Servo axis interfaces(((axis-iterface)))

image::images/GM_AxisInterface.png[align="center", scaledwidth="100%", alt="Servo axis interfaces"]


=== Encoder

The GM6-PCI motion control card has six encoder modules. 
Each encoder module has three channels:

*  Channel-A
*  Channel-B
*  Channel-I (index)

It is able to count quadrature encoder signals or step/dir signals. 
Each encoder module is connected to the inputs of the corresponding 
RJ50 axis connector.

Every encoder pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<nr. of card>.encoder.<nr of axis>
----

,where <nr of axis> is form 0 to 5. For example:

----
gm.0.encoder.0.position
----

refers to the position of encoder module of axis 0.

The GM6-PCI card counts the encoder signal independently from LinuxCNC. 
Hal pins are updated by function:

----
gm.<nr of card>.read
----

[width="80%", options="header", cols="<3,^2,<6"]
|========================================
| Pins               | Type and direction | Pin description
| .reset             | (bit, In)          | When True, resets counts and position to zero.
| .rawcounts         | (s32, Out)         | The raw count is the counts, but unaffected by reset or the index pulse.
| .counts            | (s32, Out)         | Position in encoder counts.
| .position          | (float, Out)       | Position in scaled units (=.counts/.position-scale).
| .index-enabled     | (bit, IO)          | When True, counts and position are rounded or reset 
                                            (depends on index-mode) on next rising edge of channel-I. 
											Every time position is reset because of Index, index-enabled 
											pin is set to 0 and remain 0 until connected hal pin does 
											not set it.
| .velocity          | (float, Out)       | Velocity in scaled units per second. GM encoder uses high 
                                            frequency hardware timer to measure time between encoder 
											pulses in order to calculate velocity. It greatly reduces 
											quantization noise as compared to simply differentiating 
											the position output. When the measured velocity is below 
											min-speed-estimate, the velocity output is 0.

.Parameters

.Encoder parameters

[width="80%", options="header", cols="<3,^2,<6"]
|========================================
| Parameters          | Type and Read/Write | Parameter description
| .counter-mode       | (bit, R/W)          | When True, the counter counts each rising edge of the 
                                              channel-A input to the direction determined by channel-B. 
			 	 							  This is useful for counting the output of a single channel 
			 								  (non-quadrature) or step/dir signal sensor. When false, it 
											  counts in quadrature mode.
| .index-mode         | (bit, R/W)          | When True and .index-enabled is also true, .counts and 
                                              .position are rounded (based on .counts-per-rev) at rising 
											  edge of channel-I. This is useful to correct few pulses 
											  error caused by noise. In round mode, it is essential to 
											  set .counts-per-rev parameter correctly. When .index-mode 
											  is False and .index-enabled is true, .counts and .position 
											  are reset at channel-I pulse.
| .counts-per-rev     | (s32, R/V)          | Determine how many counts are between two index pulses. It 
                                              is used only in round mode, so when both .index-enabled and 
											  .index-mode parameters are True. GM encoder process encoder signal 
											  in 4x mode, so for example in case of a 500 CPR encoder it should 
											  be set to 2000. This parameter can be easily measured by setting 
											  .index-enabled True and .index-mode False (so that .counts resets 
											  at channel-I pulse), than move axis by hand and see the maximum 
						    				  magnitude of .counts pin in halmeter.
| .index-invert       | (bit, R/W)          | When True, channel-I event (reset or round) occur on falling 
                                              edge of channel-I signal, otherwise on rising edge.
| .min-speed-estimate | (float, R/W)        | Determine the minimum measured velocity magnitude at which 
                                              .velocity will be set as nonzero. Setting this parameter too 
											  low will cause it to take a long time for velocity to go to zero 
											  after encoder pulses have stopped arriving.
| .position-scale     | (float, R/W)        | Scale in counts per length unit. .position=.counts/.position-scale. 
                                              For example, if position-scale is 2000, then 1000 counts of the 
											  encoder will produce a position of 0.5 units.
|========================================

=== Stepgen module

The GM6-PCI motion control card has six stepgen modules, one for each joint.
Each module has two output signals. It can produce Step/Direction, 
Up/Down or Quadrature (A/B) pulses. Each stepgen module is connected 
to the pins of the corresponding RJ50 axis connector.

Every stepgen pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<nr. of card>.stepgen.<nr of axis>
----

,where nr of axis is form 0 to 5. For example:

----
gm.0.stepgen.0.position-cmd
----

refers to the position command of stepgen module of axis 0 on card 0.

The GM6-PCI card generates step pulses independently from LinuxCNC. 
Hal pins are updated by function

|========================================

== CAN-bus servo amplifiers

The GM6-PCI motion control card has CAN module to drive CAN 
servo amplifiers. Implementation of higher level protocols 
like CANopen is further development. Currently GM produced 
power amplifiers has upper level driver which export pins 
and parameters to HAL. They receive position reference and 
provide encoder feedback via CAN bus.

The frames are standard (11 bit) ID frames, with 4 byte data length. 
Tha baud rate is 1 Mbit.
The position commad IDs for axis 0..5 are 0x10..0x15.
The position feedback IDs for axis 0..5 are 0x20..0x25.

These configuration can be changed with the modifivation 
of hal_gm.c and recompiling LinuxCNC.

Every CAN pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<nr. of card>.can-gm.<nr of axis>
----

,where <nr of axis> is form 0 to 5. For example:

----
gm.0.can-gm.0.position
----

refers to the output position of axis 0 in position units.

															 must be executed. The gm.<nr of card>.read 
															 is typically added to servo-thread, so 
															 watch timeout is typically set to 3 times 
															 of the servo period.

== RS485 I/O expander modules

These modules were developed for expanding the I/O and function 
capability along an RS485 line of the GM6-PCI motion control card.

Available module types:

*  8-channel relay output module - gives eight NO-NC relay output 
   on a three pole terminal connector for each channel.
*  8-channel digital input module - gives eight optical 
   isolated digital input pins.
*  8 channel ADC and 4-channel DAC module - gives four digital-to-analogue 
   converter outputs and eight analogue-to-digital inputs. 
   This module is also optically isolated from the GM6-PCI card.

*Automatic node recognizing:*

Each node connected to the bus was recognized by the GM6-PCI card automatically. 
During starting LinuxCNC, the driver export pins and parameters of all 
available modules automatically.

*Fault handling:*

If a module does not answer regularly the GM6-PCI card drops down the module.
If a module with output do not gets data with correct CRC regularly, the 
module switch to error sate (green LED blinking), and turns all outputs 
to error sate.

*Connecting the nodes:*

The modules on the bus have to be connected in serial topology, with 
termination resistors on the end. The start of the topology is the PCI 
card, and the end is the last module.

*Adressing:*

Each node on the bus has a 4 bit unique address that can be set with a red DIP switch.

*Status LED:*

A green LED indicates the status of the module:

*  Blink, when the module is only powered, but not jet identified, or when module is dropped down.
*  Off, during identification (computer is on, but LinuxCNC not started)
*  On, when it communicates continuously.
