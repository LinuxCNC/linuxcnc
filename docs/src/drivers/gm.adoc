General Mechatronics GM6-PCI card based motion control system

For detailed description, please refer to the https://www.generalmechatronics.com/data/products/robot_controller/PCI_UserManual_eng.pdf[System integration manual].

The GM6-PCI motion control card is based on an FPGA and a PCI bridge
interface ASIC. A small automated manufacturing cell can be controlled,
with a short time system integration procedure. The following figure
demonstrating the typical connection of devices related to the control
system:

* It can control up to six axis, each can be stepper or CAN bus
  interface or analogue servo.
* GPIO: Four time eight I/O pins are placed on standard flat cable headers.
* RS485 I/O expander modules: RS485 bus was designed for interfacing
  with compact DIN-rail mounted expander modules.
  An 8-channel digital input, an 8-channel relay output and an
  analogue I/O (4x +/-10 Volts output and 8x +/-5 Volts input) modules are available now.
  Up to 16 modules can be connected to the bus altogether.
* 20 optically isolated input pins: Six times three for the direct
  connection of two end switch and one homing sensor for each joint.
  And additionally, two optically isolated E-stop inputs.

=== Axis interface modules

Small sized DIN rail mounted interface modules gives easy way of connecting
different types of servo modules to the axis connectors.
Seven different system configurations are presented in the
https://www.generalmechatronics.com/data/products/robot_controller/PCI_UserManual_eng.pdf[System integration manual]
for evaluating typical applications. Also the detailed description of the
Axis modules can be found in the System integration manual.

For evaluating the appropriate servo-drive structure the modules
have to be connected as the following block diagram shows:

.Servo axis interfaces(((axis-interface)))
image::images/GM_AxisInterface.png["Servo axis interfaces",align="center",scaledwidth="100%"]


=== Encoder

The GM6-PCI motion control card has six encoder modules.
Each encoder module has three channels:

 * Channel-A
 * Channel-B
 * Channel-I (index)

It is able to count quadrature encoder signals or step/dir signals.
Each encoder module is connected to the inputs of the corresponding
RJ50 axis connector.

Every encoder pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<card_no>.encoder.<axis_no>
----

where _<axis_no>_ is from 0 to 5.
For example, `gm.0.encoder.0.position` refers to the position of encoder module of axis 0.

The GM6-PCI card counts the encoder signal independently from LinuxCNC.
HAL pins are updated by function:

----
gm.<card_no>.read
----

.Encoder pins
[width="80%",options="header",cols="<3,^2,<6"]
|===
| Pins               | Type and direction | Pin description
m| .reset             | (bit, In)          | When True, resets counts and position to zero.
m| .rawcounts         | (s32, Out)         | The raw count is the counts, but unaffected by reset or the index pulse.
m| .counts            | (s32, Out)         | Position in encoder counts.
m| .position          | (float, Out)       | Position in scaled units (=.counts/.position-scale).
m| .index-enabled     | (bit, IO)          |
When True, counts and position are rounded or reset (depends on index-mode) on next rising edge of channel-I.
Every time position is reset because of Index, the `index-enabled` pin is set to 0 and remains 0 until connected HAL pin does not set it.
m| .velocity          | (float, Out)       |
Velocity in scaled units per second.
GM encoder uses high frequency hardware timer to measure time between encoder pulses in order to calculate velocity.
It greatly reduces quantization noise as compared to simply differentiating the position output.
When the measured velocity is below min-speed-estimate, the velocity output is 0.
|===

.Encoder parameters
[width="80%",options="header",cols="<3,^2,<6"]
|===
| Parameters           | Type and Read/Write | Parameter description
m| .counter-mode       | (bit, R/W)          |
When True, the counter counts each rising edge of the channel-A input to the direction determined by channel-B.
This is useful for counting the output of a single channel (non-quadrature) or step/dir signal sensor.
When false, it counts in quadrature mode.
m| .index-mode         | (bit, R/W)          |
When True and .index-enabled is also true, .counts and .position
are rounded (based on .counts-per-rev) at rising edge of channel-I.
This is useful to correct few pulses error caused by noise.
In round mode, it is essential to set .counts-per-rev parameter correctly.
When .index-mode is False and .index-enabled is true, .counts and .position are reset at channel-I pulse.
m| .counts-per-rev     | (s32, R/V)          |
Determine how many counts are between two index pulses.
It is used only in round mode, so when both .index-enabled and .index-mode parameters are True.
GM encoder process encoder signal in 4x mode, so for example in case of a 500 CPR encoder it should be set to 2000.
This parameter can be easily measured by setting .index-enabled True and .index-mode False (so that .counts resets
at channel-I pulse), than move axis by hand and see the maximum magnitude of .counts pin in halmeter.
m| .index-invert       | (bit, R/W)          |
When True, channel-I event (reset or round) occur on falling edge of channel-I signal, otherwise on rising edge.
m| .min-speed-estimate | (float, R/W)        |
Determine the minimum measured velocity magnitude at which .velocity will be set as nonzero.
Setting this parameter too low will cause it to take a long time for velocity to go to zero after encoder pulses have stopped arriving.
m| .position-scale     | (float, R/W)        |
Scale in counts per length unit. .position=.counts/.position-scale.
For example, if position-scale is 2000, then 1000 counts of the encoder will produce a position of 0.5 units.

=== StepGen module

The GM6-PCI motion control card has six StepGen modules, one for each joint.
Each module has two output signals. It can produce Step/Direction,
Up/Down or Quadrature (A/B) pulses. Each StepGen module is connected
to the pins of the corresponding RJ50 axis connector.

Every StepGen pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<card_no>.stepgen.<axis_no>
----

where _<axis_no>_ is from 0 to 5.
For example, `gm.0.stepgen.0.position-cmd` refers to the position command of StepGen module of axis 0 on card 0.

The GM6-PCI card generates step pulses independently from LinuxCNC.

=== Enable and Fault signals

The GM6-PCI motion control card has one enable output and one fault
input HAL pins, both are connected to each RJ50 axis connector
and to the CAN connector.

HAL pins are updated by function:

----
gm.<card_no>.read
----

=== Axis DAC

The GM6-PCI motion control card has six serial axis DAC driver modules,
one for each joint. Each module is connected to the pin of the corresponding RJ50 axis connector.
Every axis DAC pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<card_no>.dac.<axis_no>
----

where _<axis_no>_ is from 0 to 5.
For example, `gm.0.dac.0.value` refers to the output voltage of DAC module of axis 0.

HAL pins are updated by function:

----

m| .low-limit     | (float, R/W)       | Minimum output voltage of the hardware in Volts.
m| .invert-serial | (float, R/W)       |
GM6-PCI card is communicating with DAC hardware via fast serial communication to highly reduce time delay compared to PWM.
DAC module is recommended to be isolated which is negating serial communication line.
In case of isolation, leave this parameter to default (0), while in case of none-isolation, set this parameter to 1.
|===

== CAN-bus servo amplifiers

The GM6-PCI motion control card has CAN module to drive CAN servo amplifiers.
Implementation of higher level protocols like CANopen is further development.
Currently GM produced power amplifiers has upper level driver which export pins and parameters to HAL.
They receive position reference and provide encoder feedback via CAN bus.

The frames are standard (11 bit) ID frames, with 4 byte data length.
The baud rate is 1 Mbit/s.
The position command IDs for axis 0..5 are 0x10..0x15.
The position feedback IDs for axis 0..5 are 0x20..0x25.

These configuration can be changed with the modification
of hal_gm.c and recompiling LinuxCNC.

Every CAN pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<card_no>.can-gm.<axis_no>
----

where _<axis_no>_ is from 0 to 5.
For example, `gm.0.can-gm.0.position` refers to the output position of axis 0 in position units.

== RS485 I/O expander modules

These modules were developed for expanding the I/O and function
capability along an RS485 line of the GM6-PCI motion control card.

Available module types:

* 8-channel relay output module - gives eight NO-NC relay output on a three pole terminal connector for each channel.
* 8-channel digital input module - gives eight optical isolated digital input pins.
* 8 channel ADC and 4-channel DAC module - gives four digital-to-analogue
  converter outputs and eight analogue-to-digital inputs.
  This module is also optically isolated from the GM6-PCI card.

.Automatic node recognizing

Each node connected to the bus was recognized by the GM6-PCI card automatically.
During starting LinuxCNC, the driver export pins and parameters of all available modules automatically.

.Fault handling

If a module does not answer regularly the GM6-PCI card drops down the module.
If a module with output do not gets data with correct CRC regularly,
the module switch to error state (green LED blinking), and turns all outputs to error state.

.Connecting the nodes

The modules on the bus have to be connected in serial topology, with termination resistors on the end.
The start of the topology is the PCI card, and the end is the last module.

.Connecting the RS485 nodes to the GM6-PCI card(((connecting-rs485)))

.Addressing

Each node on the bus has a 4 bit unique address that can be set with a red DIP switch.

.Status LED

A green LED indicates the status of the module:

* Blink, when the module is only powered, but not jet identified, or when module is dropped down.
* Off, during identification (computer is on, but LinuxCNC not started)
* On, when it communicates continuously.


=== Relay output module

For pinout, connection and electrical charasteristics of the module, please refer to the
https://www.generalmechatronics.com/data/products/robot_controller/PCI_UserManual_eng.pdf[System integration manual].

All the pins and parameters are updated by the following function:

----
gm.<card_no>.rs485
----

It should be added to servo thread or other thread with larger period to avoid CPU overload.
Every RS485 module pin and parameter name begins as follows:

----
gm.<card_no>.rs485.<module ID>
----

where _<module ID>_ is from 00 to 15.
