Vital Systems Motenc-100 and Motenc-LITE

The Vital Systems Motenc-100 and Motenc-LITE are 8- and 4-channel
servo control boards. The Motenc-100 provides 8 quadrature encoder
counters, 8 analog inputs, 8 analog outputs, 64 (68?) digital inputs,
and 32 digital outputs. The Motenc-LITE has only 4 encoder counters, 32
digital inputs and 16 digital outputs, but it still has 8 analog inputs
and 8 analog outputs. The driver automatically identifies the installed
board and exports the appropriate HAL objects.

Installing:

    loadrt hal_motenc

During loading (or attempted loading) the driver prints some usefull
debugging message to the kernel log, which can be viewed with dmesg.

Up to 4 boards may be used in one system.

== Pins

In the following pins, parameters, and functions, <board> is the board
ID. According to the naming conventions the first board should always
have an ID of zero. However this driver sets the ID based on a pair of
jumpers on the baord, so it may be non-zero even if there is only one
board.

 - (s32) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-count -- Encoder position, in counts.
 -  (float) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-position -- Encoder position, in
   user units.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-index -- Current status of index
   pulse input.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-idx-latch -- Driver sets this pin
   true when it latches an index pulse (enabled by latch-index). Cleared
   by clearing latch-index.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-latch-index -- If this pin is true,
   the driver will reset the counter on the next index pulse.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-reset-count -- If this pin is true,
   the counter will immediately be reset to zero, and the pin will be
   cleared.
 -  (float) motenc.<board>.dac-<channel>-value -- Analog output value for
   DAC (in user units, see -gain and -offset)
 -  (float) motenc.<board>.adc-<channel>-value -- Analog input value read
   by ADC (in user units, see -gain and -offset)
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.in-<channel> -- State of digital input pin, see
   canonical digital input.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.in-<channel>-not -- Inverted state of digital
   input pin, see canonical digital input.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.out-<channel> -- Value to be written to digital
   output, seen canonical digital output.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.estop-in -- Dedicated estop input, more details
   needed.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.estop-in-not -- Inverted state of dedicated estop
   input.
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.watchdog-reset -- Bidirectional, - Set TRUE to
   reset watchdog once, is automatically cleared.

== Parameters

 -  (float) motenc.<board>.enc-<channel>-scale -- The number of counts /
   user unit (to convert from counts to units).
 - (float) motenc.<board>.dac-<channel>-offset -- Sets the DAC offset.
 -  (float) motenc.<board>.dac-<channel>-gain -- Sets the DAC gain
   (scaling).
 - (float) motenc.<board>.adc-<channel>-offset -- Sets the ADC offset.
 -  (float) motenc.<board>.adc-<channel>-gain -- Sets the ADC gain
   (scaling).
 -  (bit) motenc.<board>.out-<channel>-invert -- Inverts a digital output,
   see canonical digital output.
 -  (u32) motenc.<board>.watchdog-control -- Configures the watchdog. The
   value may be a bitwise OR of the following values:  +
   
   [width="90%", options="header"]
   |========================================
   |Bit # | Value | Meaning
   |0 | 1 | Timeout is 16ms if set, 8ms if unset
   |2 | 4 | Watchdog is enabled
    |4 | 16 | Watchdog is automatically reset by DAC writes (the HAL
   dac-write
   function)
   |======================================== +
    Typically, the useful values are 0 (watchdog disabled) or 20 (8ms
   watchdog enabled, cleared by dac-write).
 - (u32) motenc.<board>.led-view -- Maps some of the I/O to onboard LEDs?

== Functions

 - (funct) motenc.<board>.encoder-read -- Reads all encoder counters.
 -  (funct) motenc.<board>.adc-read -- Reads the analog-to-digital
   converters.
 - (funct) motenc.<board>.digital-in-read -- Reads digital inputs.
 - (funct) motenc.<board>.dac-write -- Writes the voltages to the DACs.
 - (funct) motenc.<board>.digital-out-write -- Writes digital outputs.
 - (funct) motenc.<board>.misc-update -- Updates misc stuff.
