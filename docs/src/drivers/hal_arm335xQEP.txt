= arm355x eQEP encoder driver

[[cha:arm355xQEP-driver]] (((arm335x eQEP driver)))

hal_arm335xQEP is a driver for the 3 hardware quadrature decoders
built into the Beaglebone.

Installing:
----
loadrt hal_arm335xQEP encoders=eQEP{0-2}[,eQEP{0-2}][,eQEP{0-2}]

In the following Pins and Parameters, <name> is one of eQEP0, eQEP1 or eQEP2 and referes 
to the names of the hardware instance specified on the loadrt line.

== Pins

* '(s32) <name>.counts' - Position in encoder counts.
* '(bit) <name>.index-enable' - When true, counts and position are reset to 
   zero on the next rising edge of the QEPI signal. At the same time, 
   index-enable is reset to zero to indicate that the rising edge has 
   occurred.
* '(float) <name>.position' - Position in scaled units (see position-scale).
* '(float) <name>.position-interpolated' - Position in scaled units, 
   interpolated between encoder countsd.
* '(float) <name>.position-scale' - Scale factor in counts per length unit.
   For example of position-scale is 500, then 1000 counts of the encoder will
   be reported as a position of 2.0 units.
* '(s32) <name>.rawcounts' - The raw counts from the hardware register, 
   unaffected by reset or index events.
* '(bit) <name>.reset' - When true, counts and position are reset to zero.
* '(float) <name>.velocity' - Velocity in scaled units per second, When the 
   magnitude of the true velocity is below the min-speed-estimate, the
   velocity output is 0.

== Parameters

* '(float) <name>.min-speed-estimate' - Determine the minimum true velocity
   magnitude at which velocity will be estimated as non zero and 
   position-interpolated will be interpolated. The units of min-speed-estimate
   are the same as the units of velocity. Setting this parameter too low will
   cause it to take a lomg time for velocity to go to 0 after the encoder 
   pulses have stopped arriving.
* '(bit) <name>.counter_mode' - When true QEPA input will provide the clock
   for the position counter and the QEPB input will have the direction 
   information, defaults to false (quadrature count mode).
* '(bit) <name>.x2_mode' - When true count rising and falling edges in 
   counter mode, defaults to false;
* '(bit) <name>.invert_A' - invert polarity of QEPA input. 
* '(bit) <name>.invert_B' - invert polarity of QEPB input. 
* '(bit) <name>.invert_Z' - invert polarity of QEPI input. 

== Functions

* '(funct) eqep.update' - Reads all hardware counters and updates calculated
   values, for all decoders.
