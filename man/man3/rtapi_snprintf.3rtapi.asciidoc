== NAME

rtapi_snprintf, rtapi_vsnprintf -- Perform snprintf-like string formatting



== SYNTAX
 int rtapi_snprintf(char *__buf__, unsigned long int __size__, const char *__fmt__, __...__)

 int rtapi_vsnprintf(char *__buf__, unsigned long int __size__, const char *__fmt__, va_list __apfB)
__


== ARGUMENTS
As for __snprintf(3)__ or __vsnprintf(3)__.



== DESCRIPTION
These functions work like the standard C printf functions, except that a
reduced set of formatting operations are supported.

In particular: formatting of long long values is not supported.  Formatting of
floating-point values is done as though with %A even when other formats like %f
are specified.



== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
May be called from user, init/cleanup, and realtime code.



== RETURN VALUE
The number of characters written to __buf__.



== SEE ALSO
**printf(3)**
