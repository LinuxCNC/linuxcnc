== NAME

rtapi_app_exit -- User-provided function to shut down a component



== SYNTAX
void **rtapi_app_exit**(void) { __...__ }


== ARGUMENTS
None



== DESCRIPTION
The body of **rtapi_app_exit**, which is provided by the component author,
generally consists of a call to rtapi_exit or hal_exit, preceded by other
component-specific shutdown code.

This code is called when unloading a component which successfully initialized
(i.e., returned zero from its **rtapi_app_main**).  It is not called when
the component did not successfully initialize.



== RETURN CODE
None.



== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
Called automatically by the rtapi infrastructure in an initialization (not
realtime) context.



== SEE ALSO
**rtapi_app_main(3rtapi)**,
**rtapi_exit(3rtapi)**,
