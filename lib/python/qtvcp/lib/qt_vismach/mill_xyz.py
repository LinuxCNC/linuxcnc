# Concept of machine design

# The model follows logical tree design - picture the tree, with branch and smaller branches off it
# if you move the larger branch, smaller branches will move with it, but if you move smaller branch larger will not.
#
# Machine design follows that conceptal design, so for example if you move X, it can move on its own, but if you move Y,
# it will also move X assembly, as it is attached to Y assembly.
# so for this machine, tree looks like this:

# model

#   |---frame
#   |     |
#   |     |---base
#   |     |
#   |     |---column

#           |

# As you can see, lowest parts must exist first before it can be grouped with others into assembly.
# So you build upwards from lowest point in tree and assembly them together.
# Same is applicable for any design of machine. Look at machine arm example and you will see that it starts
# with tip and adds to larger part of arm then it finally groups with base.


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Box() accepts extents
# ie -100 to 100 is 200 wide, and rightmost is at -100 on coord.
#        Box(x rightmost, y futherest, z lowest, x leftmost, y nearest, z highest)
column = Box(-60, -260, 0, 60, -200, 400)

# Must define part motion before it becomes part of collection.
# Must have arguments, object itself, c (defined above), then finally scale from the pin to x y z.

# but this machine is very simple, so all axis will be purely full on axis and zero on other axis.
