How to translate NativeCAM in your own language

Required : poedit

Create a new clone of NativeCAM

locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/nativecam.po is a blank file with all the strings that need to be translated

copy this file to
locale/??/LC_MESSAGES/nativecam.po  (using your 2 letters language code, i.e. 'it', 'es', 'ru' etc)
(do not simply rename)

Open locale/??/LC_MESSAGES/nativecam.po file with poedit

Select a line and right click on it to see the source.
If the source is a cfg file, open it to learn if it is a label/name or tool_tip and what is the context
A label/name should be translated with a short string to fit in the column 'Name' of the treeview
A tool_tip does not have this limitation but keep the same format, best by copying to the translation before editing

Testing in NativeCAM
open a terminal in the cloned directory
enter 'export NATIVECAM_LOCALE="full path to locale subdirectory"' ex: '/home/USER-NAME/NativeCAM/locale'
enter 'export LANGUAGE=??'
enter ./ncam.py

There are about 900 strings to translate, do not care about 'lathe' stuff now because they all have to be redone
Be patient, it will take about 12 hours for the first pass, then 2-4 for testing

When you have started the project, you should let users know on lcnc forum to avoid someone else working on the same task

When you are satisfied, please let me know and submit your nativecam.po either with a pull request or by e-mail.

It will be included as your contribution
