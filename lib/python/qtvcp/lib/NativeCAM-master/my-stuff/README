Use this sub-directory for all your custom
files of type *.cfg, *.ngc or else but not projects

Only this file could be modified in the future,
none of yours

If you have ngc files, modify your
inifile [SUBROUTINE_PATH]
to include this sub-directory to be
the first one i.e
	ncam/my-stuff:ncam/lib/mill:ncam/lib/utilities

or have NativeCAM do it for you by running stand-alone
specifying the ini file you want modified i.e
	ncam -i your_inifile

To modify menu.xml, read catalogs/customize
