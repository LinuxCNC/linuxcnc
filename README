Refer to the file 'docs/INSTALL' for information about building and 
running the software.
    

Quickstart
----------

From the top level directory, switch to the source directory:

  cd src

In the source directory, build LinuxCNC:

  [for rtai]
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  [or, for PREEMPT-rt or vanilla kernels:]
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-realtime=uspace

  make clean
  make
  sudo make setuid

to run the software go back to the top level directory, and issue:

  . scripts/rip-environment
  linuxcnc


Unit Tests
---------

Building unit tests requires Meson (see https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html for details).

To build and run the unit tests (from the repositor root directory):

  meson build && cd build
  ninja test
