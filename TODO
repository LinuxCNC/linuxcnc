THINGS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (EMC-2.2)

TODO     Improved classicladder GUI

TODO     Convert all hardware drivers to use canonical homing, 

Fixes in HAL modules:
TODO     canonical interfaces and naming conventions

TODO     hal_m5i20 driver update
         -conform to canonical interfaces
         -enable loading of different configs
              - should be possible to load a different config on separate 
                cards if many cards are present
              - make the PWM rate a HAL parameter 
                 (currently it's specified when loading the driver)
         -enable autodetection of configs
              - 33 or 100 MHz PWM clock (affects timing calculations)
              - 4 or 8-axis config (how many ENCs and DACs, how much I/O)
         -enable writing the CCR register (is this needed?)
