# GOMC Production Readiness

Goal: prototype machines can be delivered to customers. Assumptions:

- Short access paths exist to debug/fix issues in the field (observability + deployment story required).
- All hard functional safety (protection of human life/health) is handled by **external certified hardware**.
  The software must not be silently load-bearing for any safety function — see [Safety boundary](#safety-boundary).

This document tracks the per-submodule verification pipeline. Pattern proven with milltask:
AI review vs. LinuxCNC 2.9 → findings doc → fix PRs → tests → sign-off
(see `MILLTASK_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md`).

---

## Immediate next steps

1. **Runtests against gomc** — get the existing `tests/` runtests harness (79 tests, the largest
   behavioral oracle we have) running against gomc sim configs. Every test it passes is a
   regression test we don't have to write. Track pass/fail/not-applicable per test.
2. **CI gates** — extend `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (currently builds RIP + C-side runtests only;
   **no `go test` at all today**) with a gomc job:
   - `go build ./...` + `go test -race ./...` in `src/gomc`
   - `go vet` + `golangci-lint` (incl. `staticcheck`, `unused`) — baseline first, then ratchet
   - gomc runtests subset from step 1
3. **Parity check for failing/fault paths** — the capture corpus only yielded 3 trustworthy
   oracles (lines, arcs, spindle — see `tests/milltask-parity/`). Aborts, estop, dwell-drain,
   feed-per-rev, tool-change and the sync/m66/dio programs have **no usable C oracle**.
   These need written-spec tests verified against the 2.9 C source
   (reference tree: `~/source/linuxcnc-2.9` old code), not capture conversion.

**Bug FIXED this pass (production-relevant): shutdown deadlock with ≥2 HAL threads.** Any config with `BASE_PERIOD>0` (base + servo thread — most stepper configs) hung forever on shutdown: `task_wait()` re-acquired `thread_lock` on the cooperative-exit path, so the first HAL task to be deleted exited holding it and the next task's `pthread_join` blocked. Fixed in `src/gomc/internal/hallib/uspace_rtapi_lib.c` (leave `thread_lock` released on cooperative exit). This was also the root cause of the runtests full-instance flakiness (hung shutdown → leaked gomc-server → shared-REST-port collision → stalled suite). Verified: lathe/abort-g64 now shut down ~0s; 0 leaked servers.

**Runtests progress (branch `reenable-runtests`):** Category C (standalone interp)
and the HAL `test.hal` bucket are re-enabled and green — interp 71 pass / 9
Python-skip / 1 xfail; HAL 30 pass / 0 fail / 10 skip. Infra added:
`gomc-server -f` one-shot + `-f --serve` resident HAL modes, `scripts/halrun`
shim, `tests/hal-stream-driver.sh`. Remaining: ~15 `halrun`-in-`test.sh`, the
halcompile/build tests, and the ~46 full-instance (Category D) tests (need the
Python NML→`src/gmi/python` REST port).

### Component gaps surfaced by runtests re-enablement

- **G43 Hn tool-length offset wrong — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** A tool-table `Z0.1234` yields `tool_offset[2]=3.1344` (wrong); `G43.1` (explicit offset) is correct; `G43 H2` for a nonexistent tool gives 0. Tool-table→G43 offset lookup is broken. (tests/rs274ngc-startup, tests/tlo)
- **RANDOM_TOOLCHANGER startup tool detection wrong — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** With `RANDOM_TOOLCHANGER=1`, `iocontrol.tool-number` reads 0 at startup regardless of the tool in pocket 0 (expected the loaded tool number, or -1). (tests/io-startup/random/*)
- **jog/teleop + joint-mode + limit status.** After `teleop_enable(0)` (or `mode(MANUAL)` + `setp halui.mode.joint 1`), the controller stays in TELEOP: `halui.mode.is-joint` stays FALSE and a joint jog errors "Mode is TELEOP, cannot jog joint". Also `status.limit[0]` reads -1 on a tripped min hard limit where classic expects a bitmask (1). (tests/hard-limits, tests/halui/jogging)
- **tool-tracking cluster — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** (a) `M6` does not update the interp `#<_current_tool>` (`#5400` also stale) — after `T1 M6`, `tool_in_spindle` and (post-synch) `#<_current_pocket>` are correct, but `#<_current_tool>`/`#5400` stay 0. (b) `M61 Q<n>` sets nothing — `tool_in_spindle` and `#5400` stay 0. Breaks tool-change/tool-info introspection. (tests/tool-info/*, tests/toolchanger/m61, tests/toolchanger/*, tests/t0/*)
- **user M-codes (M1xx / `[RS274NGC]USER_M_PATH`) unsupported.** `mcode_handler: no handler for M100`. Breaks any config/test using custom M-codes. (tool tests introspecting via M100)
- **abort does not restore interp modal state — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** After aborting a running program, gomc leaves the modal G-code state as the program left it instead of restoring the pre-program state: motion mode reads `G64` + blend tolerances `P1/Q2` where `G61` is expected. (tests/abort/g64)
- **g5x active coordinate system inconsistent on abort.** After aborting a program running in G55, status reports gcode `G55` but g5x active index 3 / offset (G56). Active-CS index/offset desync. (tests/statbuffer-g5x-abort)
- **`motion-logger` interceptor — DONE (cmod built + 2 tests green).** Implemented as an **interceptor/proxy** cmod (`src/emc/motion-logger/motion_logger_cmod.c` → `cmod/motion-logger.so`): registers `motctl`/`motstat` under its own instance name (milltask's `[EMCMOT]EMCMOT=motion-logger`), looks up the real motmod by `mot_instance=`, logs + forwards every call (real motmod = real motion + real status; no faking). milltask picks it up via a new `[EMCMOT]MOTION_INSTANCE` INI fallback (module.go). Converted + passing via runtests: `tests/motion-logger/{basic,mountaindew}`. Remaining: `tests/interp/m98m99/12`, `tests/abort/*crazy-move` (timing-dependent), and `tests/motion-logger/startup-gcode-abort` (blocked on the STARTUP_CODE gap below). Still TODO (under human review, `GOMC_PORT_SPEC.md` steps 2-3): rewire `tests/milltask-parity` to the interceptor, then **delete the `#ifdef MILLTASK_PARITY_TRACE` `motcmd_trace()` hook from `src/emc/motion/command.c`** so production RT carries no test instrumentation. Known gomc-vs-classic stream diffs (for the parity review): gomc omits `JOG_ABORT` for non-existent joints and the trailing `SET_SPINDLESYNC`; decoded-motctl format differs from the classic raw dump.
- **FIXED: main-program `M99` now loops in task.** gomc had the `interp_set_loop_on_main_m99` binding (`interp.go:203`) but milltask never called it, so `M99` at main level ended the program instead of looping (classic sets it in `emctask.cc:461`). Added `interp.SetLoopOnMainM99(true)` to milltask `initInterpreter`. (unblocks tests/interp/m98m99/12)
- **Minor: gomc `rs274` standalone emits extra `ON_RESET()` canon calls** vs the classic dump (one after `SET_FEED_REFERENCE`, two at `PROGRAM_END`). Benign-looking (interp reset lifecycle) but breaks byte-exact `expected` comparison; re-baselined where it appears. Worth a look if canon-call parity matters. (tests/interp/m98m99/12)
- **`ON_ABORT_COMMAND` not wired — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** gomc has the `interp.OnAbort` binding (`internal/task/interp.go:135`, `C.interp_on_abort`) but it is never called, and `[RS274NGC]ON_ABORT_COMMAND` is never read. Classic task runs the on-abort block on every abort (`emctask.cc:745` `interp.on_abort(reason, message)`). Configs using an on-abort G-code handler get nothing on abort. (tests/abort/on_abort_command-crazy-move — plus the readahead-leak bug #579 it guards)
- **`rtapi_shmem_delete` not exported to cmods.** A cmod calling `rtapi_shmem_delete` fails to dlopen ("undefined symbol: rtapi_shmem_delete"), though `rtapi_shmem_new`/`rtapi_shmem_getptr` ARE exported (shmem allocates) and delete is used internally in hal_lib.c. Add it to the cmod symbol exports. (tests/rtapi-shmem — after the .comp was fixed to proper multi-instance)
- **gmicompile `--server-go` mis-types callback/ptr params.** For an API whose func takes a callback (e.g. `handler`) or `ptr` (e.g. `user_data`) argument, the generated `_bridge.go` //export trampoline types them as `C.int`, truncating pointers. This is why `mcode_handler` had to be given a hand-written Go provider (`internal/task/mcode_provider.go`) instead of a generated bridge, and why its codegen rule still uses only `--server-c`/`--server-meta`. Fix the generator, then switch the rule to `--server-go` and drop the hand-written provider.
- **Streaming timing: live streamer/sampler doesn't preserve one-line-per-thread-cycle multiplicity.** Converted sampler/streamer HAL tests where the *temporal pattern* matters (a value held across N consecutive input lines should yield N sample rows) don't reproduce classic timing: gomc yields a different number of repeated rows (values are correct, row multiplicity differs). Stateless single-shot streams (abs.0: 7 distinct values → 7 samples) convert cleanly; held-value / debounced / stateful ones don't. Suspect the streamer advance vs sampler capture is not locked one-per-thread-cycle under the live WS feed. Blocks tests/mux, tests/multiclick (both now xfail on this, multi-instance rework done); worth checking whether "passing" streaming tests only pass because their expected was regenerated to gomc timing.
- **`gmi.Stat` missing motion queue depth.** No `queue` / `active_queue` / `queue_full` fields, though the controller has it (`motstat get_queue_depth`). Drivers that gate on readahead fill (`while s.queue > 1000`) can't. (tests/abort/{on_abort_command,stop-button}-crazy-move)
- **`RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE` never executed — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** gomc parses `[RS274NGC]RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE` into an unused field (`internal/task/config.go:174` → `task.go:308` `startupCode`, never referenced) and `module.go:305` reads `[TASK]RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE` into `interpLib` only to discard it (`_ = interpLib`). So configs relying on startup G-code (common: units/CS/tool setup like `G21 G54 …`, or `o<init> call`) get NO startup code executed. Needs task to run the startup-code lines through the interpreter at interp init (and after mode/estop transitions, per classic). (tests/motion-logger/startup-gcode-abort — xfail on this)
- **`gmi.Stat` field gaps** (client, not controller): missing `cycle_time`, `max_acceleration`, `max_velocity`, `program_units`, `queued_mdi_commands`, `tool_from_pocket`; joint position is `joint_actual_position` (not `joint_position`). Some full-instance drivers simplified their status-waits around these. (tests/startup-state, tests/mdi-queue-length)
- **CORRECTION (was wrongly reported):** `(DEBUG,msg)` / OPERATOR_DISPLAY messages DO reach the `gmi` ErrorChannel as `(13, msg)` — they work with a poll-loop + settle. (tests/interp/oword-mdi-sub-update xfails for other reasons.)
- **milltask synchronized-I/O bug (M67/M62 + blended motion) — PRODUCTION-RELEVANT.** Synchronized digital/analog output (M62/M63/M67) is not applied when the M-code is followed by multiple continuously-blended moves in AUTO. Verified: M67/M68 work via MDI, in AUTO with a single move, and in AUTO loops of single moves; they FAIL with an M67 followed by ≥2 blended moves (output pin stays 0). The trajectory planner is byte-identical to upstream 2.9 (syncdio attach `tpSetupSyncedIO` + apply `tpToggleDIOs`), and 2.9 works — so the bug is in gomc milltask's (Go) canon-command streaming: `SetAoutSyncCmd`→`set_aout`→`tp->syncdio` ordering vs the move commands→`add_line`→`tpSetupSyncedIO` during read-ahead (single `tp->syncdio` slot mis-attached/overwritten). Affects any real config using M62–M68 with continuous motion (laser/plasma/spindle-sync). Blocks tests/single-step (xfail). Fix target: `src/gomc/internal/task` canon queue/sequencer sync-I/O path.
- **FIXED: `haljson` nil-INI segfault under `gomc-server -f`.** `newHaljsonModule` dereferenced `ini.SourceFile()` to resolve a relative `config=` path even when loaded without an INI (one-shot/resident `-f` HAL file), panicking with a nil-pointer SIGSEGV — the same class of bug as the earlier pyvcp nil-INI fix. Now resolves relative paths against the cwd when `ini == nil` (`internal/haljson/module.go`). Surfaced by porting tests/halmodule.0. (Worth a sweep: any module resolving `config=` via `ini.SourceFile()` without a nil-guard has this bug.)
- **Public-header hygiene: 2 installed headers reference uninstalled headers.** `include/axis.h` `#include`s `gomc_hal.h` and `gomc_log.h` (cmodule ABI, in `src/gomc/pkg/cmodule/`, not installed), and `include/inifile.h` `#include`s `<iniparse.h>` (`libiniparse` ships but its header isn't installed). So those public headers cannot be compiled standalone by an external consumer. Fix by installing the referenced headers (or fixing the includes). Surfaced by tests/build/header-sanity (now xfail on exactly these two).
- **`libgmi.so` does not declare its `libcurl`/`libcjson` dependencies.** `objdump -p lib/libgmi.so` lists only `libc` as `NEEDED`, yet it uses curl and cJSON symbols — so external consumers must add `-lcurl -lcjson` themselves (a properly-packaged shared lib should link its own deps). Minor; tests/build/ui links them explicitly and passes. (Surfaced re-expressing the classic NML client build test against libgmi.)
- **`HAL_PORT` type not exposed via `haljson`/REST — DEFERRED (documented).** `HAL_PORT` is fully implemented in `hal_lib` (the C core), but the client boundary can't reach it: `haljson.parseHalType` only knows bit/float/s32/u32, and there is no REST read/write for port buffers. So a client (e.g. Python) cannot create or drive a PORT pin. Implementing PORT over REST is nontrivial (buffer/stream semantics) and deferred. Consequence: tests/pyhal ports its scalar (s32/u32/float/bit) coverage but omits the PORT read/write/peek portion, which is documented here rather than tested.


Real gomc behavior gaps found while converting HAL tests (tests skipped with
reasons; these are component bugs, not test problems):

- **`conv_float_u32` missing** — comp absent entirely (no cmod, not in registry). (limit3/constraints)
- **`logic` ignores `personality=`** — only the `.time` pin is created, not the configured and/or/in-NN pins. (loadrt.1)
- **`stepgen` module-param instance count** — `load stepgen <stepgen.0> step_type="2,2,2"` creates 1 instance, not 3; array module-param count doesn't drive instance count. (modparam.0)
- **`mux_generic` single-instance only** — rejects the classic multi-instance comma config (`mux-gen.NN`); errors `invalid character ',' in config string`. (mux, multiclick)
- **mb2hal debug output routing** — mb2hal INI-DEBUG dump goes to the server log, not a capturable stdout stream. (mb2hal.1a/2a)
- **one-shot `list`/`show` render nothing to stdout** — the `-f` executor's halparse path doesn't emit list/show output (worked around via resident server + `halcmd`).
- **INTENDED gomc model change (not a gap):** there is no `singleton` concept and no rt/userspace separation — a single cmod can provide both realtime and userspace behavior. So `option singleton`, `option rtapi_app no` (+ custom `rtapi_app_main`), and userspace `--install` (.c→`bin/`) have no direct modcompile equivalent BY DESIGN. Tests built on those concepts (rtapi-shmem, module-loading/rtapi-app-main-fails, halcompile/userspace-count-names) must be re-evaluated against the single-cmod model, not treated as blocked.
- **`conv_*` comp family** — FIXED: was unbuilt (generator existed but `CMOD_COMPS` wildcard missed the ungenerated files); wired into the build, all 11 now in `cmod/`. Enables `limit3/constraints`.
- **`modcompile` gaps vs `halcompile`**:
  1. **relative include path** — FIXED: modcompile now adds the source file's own directory to `-I`. (halcompile/relative-header enabled)
  2. **name-match enforcement** — FIXED: modcompile now rejects `component <name>;` != filename (normalizing `-`→`_`). (halcompile/names enabled)
  3. **personalities non-functional** — no `--personalities` flag, AND comps ignore `personality=` at load (only `.time` pin created). `modcompile --personalities=2` exits 0 (silently ignores unknown flag — modcompile likely should reject unknown flags). (halcompile/personalities_mod; ties to the `logic` personality gap above)
- **gomc HAL lock model differs** — `all|tune|none`, not the classic 4-level `LOAD/CONFIG/PARAMS/RUN`; `status`/lock rendering absent. (halrun-lock unfixable as-is)
- **No two-pass HAL loading (TWOPASS)** in gomc. (twopass, twopass-personality)
- **`halcmd getp` prints a verbose line** (`s32 OUT name = val`), not a bare value — output-parsing tests must `awk '{print $NF}'`.
- **hostmot2 sim / hm2 test comp** path not validated on gomc. (hm2-idrom)

## Review tiers

Manual review of everything is not realistic (~60k LOC of Go alone). Risk-based split:

- **Tier 1 — human review mandatory.** State machines, abort/error paths, concurrency
  ownership, and everything on the [hotspot list](#tier-1-hotspots). ~8k LOC total.
- **Tier 2 — AI review with adversarial verification.** Independent AI passes attempt to
  refute each finding; a human only adjudicates findings that survive (CONFIRMED).
  One findings doc per submodule (`<MODULE>_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md`).
- **Tier 3 — mechanical checks only.** Lint, `-race`, deadcode, and spot checks.
  Applies to generated code (`generated/gmi/*`), thin CLI wrappers, test scaffolding.

Review checklist applied in Tiers 1+2 (from the project kickoff list):

- quick fix taken instead of clean implementation
- unused code (largely automated via `staticcheck`/`unused`)
- redundant code that should be refactored
- magic numbers where enum/const should be used — is generated code (gmi) available for it?
- hand-written code where generated (gmi) code should be used
- compatibility macros or shims — none allowed
- thread-local porting hacks (no real thread/multi-instance safety)
- mix of concerns
- workarounds for missing gmi/architecture features (file as gmi feature requests instead)
- functional differences (regressions) vs. LinuxCNC 2.9
- TODO/FIXME/HACK markers (currently 18 in non-generated Go code)
- polling that should be event-driven
- artificial timeout handling
- logic and error handling validation

Known transferable risk classes from the milltask review — check explicitly in every module:

1. **Goroutine ownership** — who starts it, who stops it, shutdown ordering. 2.9 had no
   goroutines, so parity checks cannot catch this. Requires `-race` + an ownership writeup.
2. **2.9 edge parity** — error/abort paths diverge more easily than happy paths.
3. **Codegen duplication** — a bug in `gmicompile` replicates into all 39 generated packages;
   review the generator once, thoroughly, instead of its output 39 times.
4. **Fixed-but-untested** — every review fix needs a test that would have caught it.

---

## Tier 1 hotspots

Human review mandatory, in this order:

1. **pkg/hal** — the binding layer every realtime interaction crosses; 54 test lines.
   Focus: pin/signal lifecycle, type conversions, thread interaction, error propagation.
2. **gmicompile emission logic** (`internal/gmicompile/cgen`) — one wrong emission pattern
   replicates into 39 generated packages. Review generator + diff a sample of generated
   output against the IDL by hand. The parser/AST side is Tier 2.
3. **cmd/ethercat** — commands real drives, zero tests. Focus: state machine
   (INIT/PREOP/SAFEOP/OP transitions), error/timeout handling, watchdog behavior,
   behavior on slave loss/rejoin.
4. **internal/launcher + internal/daemon** — process supervision, startup/shutdown ordering,
   restart-after-crash. Focus: goroutine ownership, orphan handling, partial-startup failure.
5. **State machines & abort paths across modules** — wherever a Tier 2 AI review flags a
   state machine or abort/estop path, that section gets human eyes regardless of module tier.
6. **internal/realtime** — small, but sits on the RT boundary; verify no GC-managed
   allocation in cyclic paths.

## Cross-cutting work items

Not per-module; each needs an owner and a done-definition.

- [ ] **Safety boundary document** — list exactly which functions the external certified
  hardware covers (estop chain, limits, spindle stop, interlocks) and assert per module that
  the software is not load-bearing for any of them. <a name="safety-boundary"></a>
- [ ] **Concurrency policy** — per-module goroutine ownership writeup; `-race` gate in CI.
- [ ] **Panic/robustness policy** — recover-and-log vs. die-and-restart, decided once,
  applied everywhere; watchdog/supervision behavior documented.
- [ ] **Observability** ("short access path"): consistent structured logging levels across
  modules; crash reports persisted on machine; one-command diagnostic bundle
  (logs + halscope capture + config + version).
- [ ] **Config compatibility corpus** — parse every shipped config in `configs/` through the
  new stack as a test; existing customer 2.9 INI/HAL files must load identically.
- [ ] **Deployment/rollback** — version stamp visible in UI/logs, defined update procedure,
  rollback path for field prototypes.
- [ ] **RT/latency validation** — latency-histogram soak test on target hardware; verify Go GC
  cannot stall any cyclic path.
- [ ] **Fuzzing** — `go fuzz` targets for halparse, inifile, gmicompile parser.

## Test environment

- **Simulation configs** — gomc sim config set sufficient to run the runtests subset and
  fault-injection tests (abort mid-motion, estop during tool change, component crash/restart,
  GMI peer loss).
- **Automated integration tests** — runtests in CI (see Immediate next steps) + gomc-specific
  integration tests for what runtests cannot express (restart, supervision, GMI-level behavior).
- **Real-machine test plan** — only what simulation cannot cover: latency/jitter on target
  hardware, EtherCAT with real slaves, homing on physical switches, spindle/VFD behavior,
  diagnostic-bundle pull. Written checklist, executed per prototype before delivery.
