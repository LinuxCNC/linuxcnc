# Use this NML config on the computer running the GUI in a networked emc2
# system. The host IP address should be changed to point to the computer
# that is running the realtime code. Change the NML_FILE in emc.ini to
# client.nml and (after the server side is running) run the GUI with:
#
#        tcl/tkemc.tcl -ini emc.ini
#
# Note: tkemc.tcl does not need to be run as 'root'.
