emc interaction example
-----------------------
This needs a running EMC, for instance Axis - it does 'menu-based probing'

It does run fine in simulator mode - just fake a probe contact with the 'Simulated probe contact' button

Make sure EMC can find the probe.ngc G-code file in this directory.

run like so:
$ export INI_FILE_NAME=/home/mah/emc2/configs/sim/axis_mm_mah.ini
$ gladevcp -u probe.py -H probe.hal probe.ui

or to get a lot of debug output what gladevcp and probe.py are doing:

$ gladevcp -d -d -u probe.py -U debug=3 -H probe.hal probe.ui
