Gecko_540B4 configuration for a 4 axis machine with X Y Z A axes.

To use the charge pump on a G540 your base period must be set to 50,000 or lower. Otherwise disable the charge pump feature.

The Stepconf Wizard XML file is included so you can open it up and customize the configuration to suit your machine. After installing this configuration move the Gecko_540B4.stepconf file to the configs directory, then run the Stepconf Wizard and select Modify a configuration already created with this program.

Run the latency test to determine your max jitter and enter that in the Stepconf Wizard.

Set the axis limits, gearing for each axis.

Customize as needed to suit your machine.
