This is a config for a gantry style plasma cutting machine using stepper motors.

The configuration includes a Torch Height Control system which should be compatible with systems from SoundLogic, CandCNC and Bob Campbell.

The stepper and limit pinouts are compatible with Breakout Combo boards from Bob Campbell. This configuration is identical to plasma-thc except all input/output signals are simulated.

Don't forget to home the simulator before running a program, it needs to home before starting, otherwise there will be limit errors
