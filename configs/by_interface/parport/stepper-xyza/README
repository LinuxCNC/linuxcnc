This configuration step is intended for basic stepper machines with a rotary table.

You can have standard pinout (Machinekit style), look at stepper/ for a 'xylotex standard' example.  Certainly you could make a new one which would suit your own custom cabling.

Detailed description:

* ini files

-- inch.ini - inch setup for a stepper machine

* nml files

-- it uses a default nml file (found in configs/common/linuxcnc.nml)

* hal files

-- it uses a default stepper hal file (configs/common/core_stepper.hal)

-- standard_pinout.hal - include this from the ini to get you a standard pinout
