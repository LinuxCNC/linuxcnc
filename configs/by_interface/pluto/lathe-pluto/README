This configuration is for a hobby sized (Sherline) servo-operated lathe based on the Pluto servo driver.  The hardware is a Pluto FPGA board ($60) which counts the encoders and generates up/down PWM at high frequency in order to drive H bridges for the lathe's servos.  On this prototype machine both servos are driven with one L298 dual H bridge (which is usually used to drive one stepper.)  This is an example of (very) inexpensive servo use on a hobby machine and it gives very good performance.
