A configuration for the Universal PWM COntroller board from Pico systems.  This configuration includes motion connections and an IO set for handling estop within HAL.  The IO configuration in univpwm_io.hal does not include signal connections for other bridgeportio like signal handling.  This version takes advantage of the new UPC feature of velocity estimation to provide smoother motion, especially the functioning of the D term of the PID component.
