# Important note about OUTPUT_SCALE and PWM_OUTPUT_SCALE
# For this configuration, OUTPUT_SCALE is not used, because
# EMC always overwrites it on shutdown.  So PWM_OUTPUT_SCALE
# was added to hold the scaling.  Someday the OUTPUT_SCALE
# issue may be fixed, and PWM_OUTPUT_SCALE will go away.
# Scaling:  The PWM_OUTPUT_SCALE should be the speed 
# in UNITS/second  (inches/sec or mm/sec) that would be
# reached if the PWM duty cycle was 100%.  It depends on
# the power supply voltage, motor RPM/Volt factor, and 
# gearing/screw pitch.  For example:
#
# Power supply voltage 50V
# Motor RPM/V     1000RPM/24V
# Gearing:  2 motor revs per 1 screw rev
# Screw pitch: 0.2" per turn
# 
# Max motor speed = 50V * 1000RPM/24V = 2083 RPM
# Max screw speed = 2083RPM * 1(screw)/2(motor) = 1041RPM
# Max table speed = 1041RPM * 0.2"/turn = 208 in/min
# Max table speed = 208 in/min / 60 seconds = 3.47 inches/sec
#
# Since max speed is reached at 100% duty cycle, PWM_OUTPUT_SCALE
# should be 3.47
