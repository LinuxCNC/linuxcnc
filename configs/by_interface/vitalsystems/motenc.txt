This configuration is intended for servo machines running the Vitalsystems (www.vsi99.com) Motenc-100 or Motenc-Lite card.

You can either have a standard pinout, or you could make a new one which would suit your own custom cabling. The changes are done in HAL (the Hardware Abstraction Layer), which is very flexible (read more about it at http://wiki.machinekit.org/)

The standard configuration assumes a card installed with the board id jumper set at 0. If you get errors, try to adjust the jumper.

Multiple cards are supported by reading the board id jumper settings and using them as the <boardId> in the exported HAL names. There are two jumpers on J3 of the motenc-100 board that are defined as the board id. Installing a jumper causes the corresponding bit to read as zero. Since there are two board id jumpers, up to four cards are supported. Using the board id allows the configuration to be independent of which PCI slot the card is plugged into.

Detailed description:

* nml files

-- it uses a default nml file (found in configs/common/linuxcnc.nml)

* hal files

-- it uses a default servo hal file (configs/common/core_servo.hal)

-- motenc_motion.hal - this is the main hal file for the Motenc, it loads the motenc driver and sets up motion specific links, it is fairly well commented, so it should be easy to read / modify.

-- motenc_io.hal - this is the second hal file for the Motenc, it configures IO specific links (like the pin number where the X limit switch is, or where the spindle start pin is connected), it is fairly well commented, so it should be easy to read / modify.  This servo setup is mostly for serious machines, so the ESTOP should really be planned / implemented properly (that means use an external ESTOP chain, and let Machinekit know about it, and let Machinekit interrupt the external chain too).

* additional files

-- motenc.tbl - this is the tool table file, and it holds definitions for the tools used, along with tool sizes for compensation (tool length & tool diameter)

-- motenc.var - the variables file. This file is used by the interpreter to save internal variables when Machinekit shuts down, and rereads them on the next startup.
