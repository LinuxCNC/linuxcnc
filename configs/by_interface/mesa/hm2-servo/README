This configuration drives a 3-axis servo machine using a Mesa AnythingIO board with the HostMot2 firmware.  The config will only run if you have the card installed and have installed the firmware.

See the HostMot2 section of the Integrators manual for more information.

All 3 axes use a home switch.  All home switches are connected to a single shared input pin.  X and Z home without encoder index, Y homes with encoder index.

No limit switches are used.

These configs have 3 Encoders, 3 PWMs, and 0 StepGens
