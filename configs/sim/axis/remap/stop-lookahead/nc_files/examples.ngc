; demo for stopping interpreter readahead
;
; assuming the G13 line is commented out, what would happen is:
;
; the interpreter parses and queues the msg commands, then encounters abort
; and immediately flushes the interpreter queue
; consequence: the message from (msg,xx) dont appear since they are flushed before they can be executed by
; task and the gui.
;
; if G13 is active, this means interpreter readahead stops at that very line until all preceding
; commands have been executed 
; hence the messages appear in that case

(msg,one)
(msg,two)
(msg,three)

G13 (dont lookahead further)
o10 if [#<_task> EQ 1] (this avoids an abort message when starting the config)
 (abort, aborting)
o10 endif
