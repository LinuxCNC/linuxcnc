This shows how the builtin T,M6,M61,S,F codes can be redefined, optionally by referring to the builtin behaviour in the remap procedure.

The collection of prologs and epilogs in python-stdglue is intended to be a boilerplate set of Python glue which covers most use cases. Normally you shouldnt need to touch any of these.

The ngc remap routines in nc_subroutines have been set up to:

show the 'exposed parameters' with a debug statement

refer to the builtin codes within the remap procedure, such that execution effect is the same as not remapping that code (i.e. the remap result is idempotent)

to work with the stdglue prologs and epilogs

'exposed parameters' are local variables in the remap procedure which can be read, and changed - any changes will be picked up by the epilog and used to commit the result


Note that using M61 requires iocontrol-v2 as set tool number support in iocontrol is broken.

update:

Remapping and extending of M0,M1,M60 added.
