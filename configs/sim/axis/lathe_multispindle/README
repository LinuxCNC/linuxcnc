This is a simulation of a 2-spindle lathe to demonstrate the multispindle patch.

up to 8 spindles are supported, set by [TRAJ]SPINDLES in the INI and a 
num_spindles modparam to motmod. These _must_ agree with each other. 

There are still some things to shake-down regarding default behaviours if no
spindle is selected. 

Most spindle-related commands now take an extra "E" word to say which spindle 
to apply them to. The exception is G76 which already used E, so now uses D for
spindle. 

The docs in this branch have not been updated to reflect new behaviour. 

Examples

S1000 E1 - set the speed of spindle 1 to 1000
M3 S100 E0 - set the speed of spindle 0 to 100

G33 X10 K1.5 E1 - make a move synchronised to spindle 1
G33.2 Z-1 K1 E0 - rigid tap synchronised to spindle 0.

M51 P0 E6 - disable speed override on spindle 6. M48 and M49 operate on all.
