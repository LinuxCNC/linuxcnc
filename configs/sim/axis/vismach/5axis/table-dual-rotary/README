Switchable Table Dual Rotary (tdr) Sim config

xyzab-tdr (switchable kinematics)


Demonstrations:

For a demonstration of XYZAB_TCP kinematics the user can run the preloaded demo gcode with the default offsets.

In the right hand panel of the axis gui sliders are provided to

- change the geometrical (x,z)-offsets as measured from the rotation-point of the A/B rotary-assembly to the
  face center of the rotary A table. The offsets are visibly adjusted in the vismach simulation and represented by a red indicator
  for the x-offset and a blue indicator for the z-offset.

- see the effects of misconfiguring the (x,y,z)-rot-point values used in the kinematics. These values represent the
  physical position of the rotary-assembly in the machine as measured from the machine home position to the rotation-point
  of the assembly. The rotation-point is identical to the intersection of the two rotational axes A and B when the (x,z)-offsets
  are zero. When (x,z)-offsets are applied the rotation-point stays on the rotational B axis. The 'rot-point' as set by
  these values as well as the true rotation-point of the rotary-assembly are indicated in the vismach simulation by a yellow cross
  and a red sphere respectively.

NOTE:
For proper tool-path preview RELOAD THE CGODE after startup and after changing offset values.
