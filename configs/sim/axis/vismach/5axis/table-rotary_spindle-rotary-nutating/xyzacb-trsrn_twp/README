This is a simulation configuration for a 6 axis machine with the following kinematic:

XYZ - linear cartesian
  A - table rotary
  C - spindle rotary
  B - spindle nutating

The spindle rotary assembly is fully configurable using sliders in the side panel of the gui

The kinematic component includes the following modes:

IDENTITY: Trivial kinematics with a one-to-one mapping of joints to axes 
     TCP: Coordinated xyz motion with rotation around the tool center point
    TOOL: Coordinated xyz motion in the current tool coordinate system
