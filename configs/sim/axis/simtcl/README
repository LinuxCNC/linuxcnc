The simtcl configuration files make use of the tcl language for configuration instead of the more common ".hal" files.

Configurations in this directory also demonstrate the use of a twopass method of processing ".hal" and ".tcl" files.  This method is enabled by the ini file setting of [HAL]TWOPASS=anything.  With twopass processing, the loadrt specifiers for a module can be specified in multiple places.

o twopass_compat
  verify compatibility with .hal halfiles

o twopass_basic
  use LIB example basic_sim

Notes:

Conventionally, hal is configured with ".hal" files which contain instructions in the halcmd language.  With ".tcl" files, common programming facilities like looping and testing are available too.

Hal configuration files are specified by ini file [HAL]HALFILE items which can name either ".hal" or ".tcl" files.
