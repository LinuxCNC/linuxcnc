dynamic_offsets

A sinewave is applied to the Z coordinate external offset

The waveform amplitdude and frequency are set by pyvcp panel spinboxes.

The Z coordinate max acceleration and max velocity settings (from the ini file) can be modified with pyvcp panel spinboxes.

Usage:
  1) Estop OFF  (F1)
  2) Machine ON (F2)
  3) HOME All   (Ctrl-Home)
  4) A halscope application is started to
     show the offset waveforms and the
     z coordinate response 
  5) Enable the dynamic offset waveform
     with the panel 'Z enable' checkbox
  5) Use the panel to adjust:
       Waveform:     amplitude, frequency
       Z Coordinate: max accel, max vel

Notes:
  The dynamic waveform is applied with and without
  running a program.

  MDI cannot be started with non-zero external
  offsets -- disable the Z offsets and toggle
  the machine On/Off to zero offsets.

  Changes to the Z max accel, max vel are not
  made while a program or mdi move is in progress.
