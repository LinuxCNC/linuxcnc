Select one of these if you have no functional machine but want to edit some basic configuration stuff or play with one of the LinuxCNC displays.

Additional configurations are provided in subdirectories.

These configurations demonstrate LinuxCNC functionality using the axis gui as the interface.  (The functionality demonstrated may be available in other guis also)
