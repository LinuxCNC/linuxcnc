This config is a simulated stepper machine with the addition of ClassicLadder connections to some of the Machinekit IO.

The initial ladder program includes several possible estop arrangements and a timed lube coil.  The lube ladder includes a sense run that watches lube level or lube pressure and warns of a lube condition failure.

This ladder integration with the HAL will allow you to expand the IO interface to a minimill with spindle and tool changer controls.
