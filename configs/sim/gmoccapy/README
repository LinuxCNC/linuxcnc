A touch screen user interface for mills, lathes and plasma cutters.
Based of the design of moccagui, a GUI coded in FreePascal.
GMOCCAPY is using Python instead.

GMOCCAPY is designed to bring the feel of industrial controls to LinuxCNC users,
most controls can be used with a touch screen and also most are accessible through
hal pins, so real hardware can be used.
